Amid renewed interest in Medicaid work requirements as part of a broader legislative package designed to significantly reduce federal Medicaid spending, KFF has updated its analysis of the work status and demographic characteristics of Medicaid enrollees with the latest data.

Data show that, in 2023, 92% of Medicaid adults were either working full or part-time (64%), or were not working due to barriers to work such as caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability, or school attendance -- reasons that counted as qualifying exemptions from the work requirements under previous policies.
