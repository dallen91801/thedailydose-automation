    "text": "Investigation and Outcomes\n\nCase Identification\n\nA previously healthy woman aged 71 years developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within 4 days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died 8 days after symptom onset. Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nIdentification of Potential Sources of Contamination\n\nAn epidemiologic investigation conducted by the Texas Department of State Health Services included a review of the patient’s medical and exposure history. The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using nonboiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the 4 days before illness onset. This practice suggested two water sources of concern. The first was the RV’s potable water tank, which flowed directly to the faucets and shower when a municipal water connection was unavailable. The tank had been filled with water collected on an unknown date before the patient’s purchase of the RV 3 months earlier. The second potential source of contamination was the municipal water system, which was connected by a hose and water filter to the RV potable water system, bypassing the tank, at the time the patient used it for nasal irrigation.\n\nEnvironmental Sampling\n\nTo evaluate these water sources, investigators collected 12 environmental samples. These samples included the patient’s nasal irrigation squirt bottle; 1 liter of water from the RV water heater; swabs from the RV shower head and kitchen and bathroom sink faucets; one large volume (approximately 4 gal [15 L]) ultrafiltered water sample and one swab of the RV potable water tank; one large volume (approximately 26 gal [100 L]) ultrafiltered water sample and one swab from the campsite municipal water where the RV connected; the RV external water filter; the RV municipal connection hose; and another large volume (approximately 26 gal [100 L]) ultrafiltered water sample from a low flow (i.e., dead-end) campsite municipal water connection.\n\nTesting for N. fowleri and Water Quality\n\nPhysical and chemical water quality parameters were assessed at the time of sampling, and all samples were tested for N. fowleri at CDC. No N. fowleri DNA or viable ameba were detected in any environmental samples collected at the campsite water sources or in the RV water system. However, the total chlorine and monochloramine (i.e., disinfectant) levels in the low flow campsite municipal distribution system sample (both <0.04 mg/L) were below the minimum disinfectant residual levels recommended by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (≥0.50 mg/L monochloramine or total chlorine).† In addition, the presence of free ammonia, lower pH (<8.5), and unequal concentrations of active disinfectant (measured as a concentration of monochloramine) and total chlorine (which represents all forms of chlorine, including less effective forms) at the campsite where the RV was connected indicated suboptimal disinfection efficacy, which might have led to biofilm growth. Biofilm can grow when water becomes stagnant or disinfectant residuals are depleted, resulting in pathogen growth. Although no test for the presence of biofilms exists, biofilms can act as a protective shield for pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria and amebas such as N. fowleri, making the amebas less susceptible to disinfectant (5). Further, the turbidity (i.e., the cloudiness of water) measured at taps and inside the RV was significantly higher (range = 1.26–4.32 nephelometric turbidity units [NTUs])§ than that recommended for drinking water (<1.0 NTU), suggesting a disinfection breakdown. Insufficient disinfectant residual entering the RV and high turbidity at the point of use might have contributed to the presence of thermophilic ameba, although these were not detected in the samples tested.",

    "text": "Results\n\nAccording to 2022–2023 BRFSS data, 457,586 respondents were current or recent workers. Among them, 294,606 (64%) were administered the I&O module, 334,241 (73%) were administered the SD/HE module, and 221,681 (48%) were administered both modules. Respondents who reported active military duty status (998; 0.4%) and those for whom occupation was missing, insufficient to code, or with I&O module data indicating that the respondent was not actually working for pay (44,548; 20%) were excluded. In addition, 35,813 participants, including some who were excluded for other reasons, did not respond to any of the six SD/HE questions and were also ineligible, leaving a final study population of 165,060.\n\nOverall, 6.9% of current or recent U.S. workers aged ≥18 years reported at least four types of economic hardship (Table 2). Job loss or reduction in work hours was the most frequently reported economic hardship (16.5%), and lack of reliable transportation the least common (6.7%). The prevalence of several other hardship indicators exceeded 10%, including food insecurity (12.1%), housing insecurity (12.2%), and cost preventing needed medical visits (11.8%).\n\nDifferences by Sociodemographic Characteristics\n\nCompared with all workers, for each type of economic hardship, prevalence was statistically significantly elevated among respondents who were out of work for <1 year, were aged 18–49 years (particularly 18–24 years), were Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), had a high school education or less, or had household incomes <$50,000. Prevalences were statistically significantly higher among female than male workers for five of the eight categories of hardship: food insecurity (13.8% of women versus 10.7% of men), receipt of food stamps or SNAP (12.0% versus 5.0%), housing insecurity (14.3% versus 10.5%), threatened utility cutoff (9.0% versus 6.6%), cost preventing needed medical care (13.0% versus 10.8%), and high levels of economic hardship (7.9% versus 6.0%). However, a higher percentage of male workers lacked health insurance (11.7%) than did female workers (6.9%). Compared with all workers combined, fair or poor general health was statistically significantly more common among respondents who were out of work for <1 year, were Hispanic, had a high school education or less, or had household incomes <$50,000.\n\nDifferences by Occupational Group\n\nHigh levels of economic hardship were most common in the farming, fishing, and forestry (18.5%) occupational group; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance (18.2%); and food preparation and serving (16.0%) and were lowest for the legal occupations (1.2%) (Table 3). Prevalences of high levels of economic hardship exceeded 10% for three additional occupational groups: health care support (14.1%), construction and extraction (11.6%), and transportation and materials manufacturing (10.6%). U.S. Department of Labor data indicate 2023 mean annual wages were <$50,000 and median annual wages were <$45,000 for all occupational groups with high levels of economic hardship prevalences (≥10%), except construction and extraction (mean annual wage = $61,500; median = $55,680). Prevalences of the two health care measures, lacking health insurance and cost preventing needed medical care, were statistically significantly elevated for each occupational group with a high level of economic hardship except health care support. The prevalence of fair or poor health generally increased with the percentage of the occupation experiencing high economic hardship. With the exception of construction and extraction, this prevalence was statistically significantly elevated in every occupational group with a high level of economic hardship, compared with all workers combined.\n\nSociodemographic Characteristics of Occupational Groups with High Levels of Economic Hardship\n\nSeveral occupational groups with the highest prevalences of high levels of economic hardship had disproportionate percentages of workers from demographic groups with high prevalences of economic hardship and fair or poor health (Supplementary Table). Within the farming, fishing, and forestry occupational group, 66.5% of workers reported Hispanic ethnicity (compared with 20.6% of all workers), and 54.8% had not completed high school (compared with 9.5% of all workers). Within the building and grounds cleaning and maintenance occupational group, 52.7% of workers reported Hispanic ethnicity, and 37.4% had not completed high school. Prevalences of each economic hardship indicator, high economic cost, and fair or poor health were statistically significantly elevated among both Hispanic workers and those who had not completed high school. Each economic hardship measure was statistically significantly elevated in young workers, and a majority of economic hardship measures were statistically significantly elevated among female and Black workers; however, the prevalence of fair or poor health was not significantly elevated in these demographic groups. The highest prevalence of workers aged <35 years (57.6% versus 32.6% of all workers) was in the food preparation and serving industry. The health care support occupational group had the highest prevalence of female workers (83.0% versus 46.6% of all workers) and the second highest prevalence of non-Hispanic Black workers (20.1% versus 10.5% of all workers).",

    "text": "Discussion\n\nDespite warnings from CPSC, nursing pillow manufacturers, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) about the dangers posed by nursing pillows in sleep spaces for infants (3), the number of SUID cases with a nursing pillow present as a possible factor in a sleep-related infant death increased in Georgia from 2013 to 2022. The presence of any soft object, including a nursing pillow, in an infant sleep space is a risk factor for SUID (2). A mandatory federal safety standard proposed by CPSC in September 2024 and implemented in April 2025 includes new warning label requirements for nursing pillows.†† Although all nursing pillows now have a label, current marketing strategies by certain nursing pillow manufacturers and retailers do not stipulate that the pillow is intended only for infant feeding and suggest in promotional images or directly state in other advertisements that the pillow can be used for infant “lounging.” This can be confusing for consumers, some of whom might assume that nursing pillows are intended to be used to support sleeping infants.\n\nIn 17.9% of SUIDs with a nursing pillow as a possible factor in the death, the infant was confirmed to be formula-fed; however, information about whether a bottle was found in the infant sleep space was not available. Because breastfeeding has been shown to be protective against SUID (6), community groups have found that distributing nursing pillows can encourage breastfeeding (7). However, products used to facilitate breastfeeding should not pose unintended risks to the infant. This analysis highlights the importance of keeping soft objects out of the infant sleep space and of educating caregivers about the intended use of these pillows, and the potential risks associated with using them in infants’ sleep environments, when distributing them in the community to promote breastfeeding.\n\nThese data provide additional evidence that nursing pillows should not be placed in infants’ sleep spaces and should not be used for shared surfaces. The majority of cases in this study occurred in the adult bed, providing additional data indicating that adult beds are not a safe surface for infants, even if a nursing pillow is used. Community advocates, health care providers, and nurses could play a critical role in educating families about the ABC’s (alone, back, crib) of safe infant sleep before hospital discharge, at the 1- or 2-week pediatric primary care follow-up, and at the 2-month follow-up visit. These are all convenient and ideal times for reinforcing education about safe sleep practices and proper use of the nursing pillows.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, CDR data are limited to the information collected by CDR teams at the county level and likely underrepresent the number of deaths. Second, although CDRs are mandated by Georgia law, not all deaths among children are reviewed quickly, accurately, or systematically, which limits the ability to infer causal relationships.§§ Therefore, the cases reviewed for this study likely do not reflect the total number of SUIDs that occurred in Georgia during 2013–2022. Third, the data are limited by the information collected during the death investigation; for the cases in this study, the exact role of the nursing pillow in the death was either unknown or undocumented. Fourth, the postmortem medical diagnoses for SIDS and SUID are similar, and it is possible that certain deaths included in this analysis should have been excluded because they were attributable to a specific cause of death, such as a respiratory virus or medical complication. However, because the data were missing, these deaths could not be screened out; steps were taken to reduce this to the extent possible (8). Finally, the demographic data captured in this data set are limited by incomplete data collection and misclassification. For example, although major metropolitan areas within Georgia are home to large numbers of Asian populations, no deaths among Asian infants were captured. Details about cultural practices and behaviors that might affect the sleep of infants are not systematically captured by this dataset, which inherently limits identification of subpopulations that might disproportionately use nursing pillows in infant sleep spaces.\n\nImplications for Public Health Practice\n\nThis study highlights how use of state and local child death review data via NCFRP can guide understanding of a widespread practice with public health implications. The national Safe to Sleep campaign (originally the Back to Sleep Campaign in 1994),¶¶ has played a substantial role in promoting strategies to reduce sleep-related deaths among infants. Given the increase in sleep-related infant deaths nationwide (9) and within Georgia, public health programs to continue this work are essential (2). Some products meant to ease infant care and support parents might contribute to SUID risk if they are not appropriately labeled and used as intended. Until April 2025, nursing pillows lacked labeling describing the potential hazards of using the products in infant sleep spaces, which could contribute to the number of deaths identified in this analysis. The new CPSC safety standard for labeling was implemented in April, with warnings that infants have died while using nursing pillows for sleep or lounging, infants can suffocate within minutes, and the product should only be used to feed infants who remain awake. These new labeling requirements might help prevent infant deaths associated with using nursing pillows being used in ways other than their intended use as a feeding aid.\n\nHowever, even with new labeling requirements, nursing pillows could continue to pose a risk in sleep spaces for infants. Public health interventions such as messaging for parents, caregivers, and health care providers about the dangers of using nursing pillows in an unintended way could prevent deaths among infants. National evidence-based guidelines, in coordination with AAP guidelines, could help provide consistent messaging, educational materials, and warnings among jurisdictions, while guiding research and interventions to reduce infant deaths.",

    "text": "Discussion\n\nThis analysis of 2017–2023 MERS data facilitated comparisons of numbers of global cases, U.S. specimens tested, arriving U.S. travelers from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula, and U.S. PUIs before and after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. After the COVID-19 pandemic began, the average number of reported MERS cases declined sharply, with most cases still reported by Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt is possible that global reporting of MERS cases declined because cases were missed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The strain placed on health care and public health systems by the pandemic might also have limited identification of patients with risk factors for MERS; in addition, access to and volume of testing might have declined. These factors could have resulted in surveillance bias and declines in reported cases.\n\nOther factors might be contributing to the decrease in reported global MERS cases, including pandemic mitigation measures, changes in interactions with camels,¶¶¶¶ potential cross-protection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 against MERS-CoV, and virologic changes (9,10); sustained submission of MERS-CoV genomic sequences to open-access databases is critical to identifying potential virologic changes (10). Further research and data-sharing are needed to better understand the causes of this large decrease in reported cases.\n\nDuring 2017–2019, U.S. MERS-CoV testing volume and the total numbers of incoming travelers from in or near the Arabian Peninsula remained stable and exhibited summer peaks related to Hajj***** and travel. Both the number of incoming travelers to the United States and identification and testing of MERS PUIs decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, although international travel has largely returned to prepandemic levels, the number of U.S. specimens submitted for MERS-CoV testing has remained low. If the proportion of persons who meet PUI clinical criteria were to remain constant, U.S. MERS-CoV testing would be expected to be higher to mirror the increases in travelers. Furthermore, understanding where travelers arrive in the United States might help guide state and local health departments concerning the possible risks and need for MERS-CoV testing.\n\nThe findings in this report might help to guide MERS preparedness priorities and activities. The decrease in the number of global MERS cases, and the potential causes for this decline, should be further investigated, including through surveillance evaluations, immunologic studies, and genomic sequencing. Despite decreases in globally reported human MERS cases, the United States remains at possible risk for MERS. Data do not support reduction in the virologic prevalence of MERS-CoV in camels. Ensuring that a comprehensive One Health approach, connecting human, animal, and environmental health, is taken to assess the risk for MERS globally and within the United States is vital to maintaining adequate preparedness activities. In light of these considerations, traveler and testing data can provide information regarding testing needs, testing capacity, and appropriate surveillance strategies. More specifically, jurisdictions with airports receiving high volumes of travelers from in or near the Arabian Peninsula are strategic locations for strengthening MERS testing and surveillance approaches.\n\nIn 2024, CDC released updated criteria for testing MERS PUIs for MERS-CoV infection (Diagnostic Testing for MERS | MERS | CDC) to incorporate 1) emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as another cause of severe respiratory illness, 2) increased use of multiplex pathogen detection platforms, and 3) evidence related to potential MERS-CoV spillover from camels to humans in parts of Africa (4,5). These updates included clarification of clinical criteria and the expansion of epidemiologic risks criteria to include 1) direct camel contact in or near the Arabian Peninsula as a risk factor for those with mild illness, 2) direct camel contact among patients with severe presentation and recent travel to regions of Africa,††††† and 3) occupational exposure among laboratorians or researchers handling infectious MERS-CoV material.§§§§§ U.S. clinicians should obtain a thorough travel history from patients with acute respiratory illness of unknown etiology, and work with their jurisdictional public health departments to obtain MERS testing for patients who meet MERS PUI testing criteria. CDC will continue to maintain and update MERS PUI testing criteria as new information emerges. Further MERS materials and guidance is available on CDC and WHO websites.¶¶¶¶¶\n\nLimitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, MERS cases reported to WHO reflect data submitted by member nations through the 2005 International Health Regulations mechanism; data completeness and quality vary. Second, the U.S. MERS-CoV testing data include minimal metadata, thus limiting epidemiologic and PUI analyses. Third, OAG data are modeled using ticket sales, which might not reflect the true number of travelers. Finally, traveler origin country is a proxy for countries where MERS-CoV is likely endemic; it does not identify other risk factors.\n\nImplications for Public Health Practice\n\nEpidemiologic, testing, and traveler data are indicators that are essential to guiding public health investigations and readiness activities. Strengthening MERS-CoV surveillance and ongoing risk assessments are critical to supporting MERS-CoV and more broadly novel coronavirus pandemic preparedness and surveillance. Continued and targeted MERS-CoV surveillance is important to maintaining preparedness and promptly responding to potential MERS cases.",

    "text": "Abstract\n\nProblem/Condition: Candidemia, a bloodstream infection caused by Candida spp., is a common cause of health care–associated bloodstream infections in the United States. Candidemia is associated with substantial health care costs, morbidity, and mortality.\n\nPeriod Covered: 2017–2021.\n\nDescription of System: CDC’s Emerging Infections Program (EIP), a collaboration among CDC, state health departments, and academic partners, was used to conduct active, population-based laboratory surveillance for candidemia at city or county sites located in 10 states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee), representing a combined population of approximately 21.5 million persons, or 7% of the U.S. population in 2019. Connecticut began reporting cases on January 1, 2019, and conducts statewide surveillance. Although candidemia is not a nationally notifiable condition, cases of Candida auris infection are nationally notifiable, and cases of candidemia caused by C. auris could be included in both national case counts and EIP surveillance. A culture-confirmed candidemia case is defined as a positive blood culture for any Candida sp. from a resident in the surveillance catchment area. Subsequent positive blood cultures for Candida within 30 days of the initial positive culture (index date) in the same patient are considered part of the same case. Clinical laboratories serving each catchment area report candidemia cases, and trained surveillance officers abstract information from medical charts for all cases. Corresponding isolates are sent to CDC for species confirmation and antifungal susceptibility testing.\n\nResults: A total of 7,381 candidemia cases were identified during the surveillance period (2017–2021). The overall incidence was 7.4 cases per 100,000 population. Across age groups, sexes, racial and ethnic groups, and surveillance sites, incidence was generally stable or increased slightly from 2017 to 2021, with the lowest overall incidence in 2019 (6.8) and the highest in 2021 (7.9). In 2021, candidemia incidence was highest in patients aged ≥65 years (22.7) and infants (aged <1 year) (8.0). Incidence was higher in males (8.7) compared with females (7.0) and higher in non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) patients (12.8) compared with non-Black patients (5.6). Incidence was highest in Maryland (14.5), followed by Tennessee (10.1) and Georgia (10.0); incidence was lowest in Oregon (4.8). Increases occurred in the percentage of cases classified as health care onset (52.2% in 2017 to 58.0% in 2021). Overall, among 7,381 cases (in 6,235 patients), 63.7% occurred in patients who had a central venous catheter, 80.7% involved recent systemic antibiotic receipt, and 9.0% occurred in patients who had a history of injection drug use. The percentage of cases with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during the 90 days before or after the index date increased from 10.4% in 2020 to 17.7% in 2021. From 2017 to 2021, the percentage of cases involving an intensive care unit stay before the index date increased from 38.3% to 44.9%. Echinocandins (e.g., micafungin) were used as treatment in 49.8% of cases, and azoles were used in 47.7%. The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 32.6%; this increased from 26.8% in 2019 to 36.1% in 2021. Overall, Candida albicans accounted for 37.1% of cases, followed by Candida glabrata (30.4%) and Candida parapsilosis (13.5%); however, C. glabrata was the most frequent species in California (38.4%) and Maryland (32.9%). Candida auris infections accounted for 0.4% of cases. Among 6,576 Candida isolates for which interpretive breakpoints exist and isolates were available for testing, 5.6% were fluconazole resistant, and <1% were echinocandin resistant. Antifungal resistance was stable for all antifungals tested across years.\n\nInterpretation: Candidemia remains an important health care–associated infection. The disproportionate incidence among older adults, males, and Black patients is consistent with previous reports, and the overall incidence of candidemia has not changed substantially compared with previous EIP findings based on data collected during 2012–2016 (8.7 per 100,000 population). The higher mortality rate associated with candidemia during 2020–2021 likely reflects consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including strained health care systems and an increased population of patients who were susceptible to candidemia because of COVID-19–related critical illness.\n\nPublic Health Action: Strict implementation of measures to prevent health care–associated bloodstream infections is important to help prevent candidemia cases. Health care officials and providers should be vigilant for candidemia as a complication of critical illness. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor for emerging populations at risk for candidemia and changes in antifungal resistance patterns, which can help guide antifungal treatment selection.",

In prior fiscal years, funding for UNICEF and UNFPA was provided through the IO&P account. 8 – The FY24 final bill states that “not less than $575,000,000 should be made available for family planning/reproductive health.” 9 – The FY24 final bill states that if this funding is not provided to UNFPA it “shall be transferred to the ‘Global Health Programs’ account and shall be made available for family planning, maternal, and reproductive health activities.” 10 – The explanatory statement accompanying the FY24 final appropriations bill states that the agreement includes “up to $100,000,000 for a contribution to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).” 11 – The FY24 final bill states that “up to $70,000,000 of the funds made available under the heading ‘Global Health Programs’ may be made available for the Emergency Reserve Fund” without specifying whether this funding would come from GHS amounts or potentially other areas. 12 – The FY26 Request states that funding from the GHP account may be provided to the “Emergency Reserve Fund” without specifying an amount. 13 – The explanatory statement accompanying the FY24 final bill states that “of the funds made available for ‘Other Public Health Threats’ … the agreement includes up to $6,000,000 for the Health Reserve Fund.” 14 – The explanatory statement accompanying the FY24 final bill states that “of the funds made available for ‘Other Public Health Threats’… the agreement includes not less than $10,000,000 to support the global health workforce.” 15 – The FY26 Request eliminates CDC’s Global Health Center and most of its bilateral programs, except funding for “Global Disease Detection & Emergency Response”, which is transferred to “Crosscutting Activities and Program Support”, and “Parasitic Diseases and Malaria”, which is transferred to “Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases”. The FY26 budget request specifies the funding level for “Global Disease Detection & Emergency Response”, but not “Parasitic Diseases and Malaria”. 16 – Additional global health funding for research activities at NIH is determined at the agency/department level and is not yet known for either FY25 or the FY26 Request.",

    "text": "The federal government routinely relies on external advisory committees to inform policy across multiple areas. In the context of vaccines, these include several committees that assist in informing the government on vaccine policy, vaccine approvals, and vaccine recommendations for use among the public. Still, while advisory committees have served an important function in this regard for years, members of the Trump administration have raised critiques and questions about the role of these committees and taken actions in the past few weeks that have bypassed their input altogether. For example, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has long raised concerns about conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency on federal vaccine advisory committees, and has recently said he intends to make changes to these committees. In recent days, officials at HHS and FDA announced a number of changes to policies regarding the review, approval, and recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, which were implemented without any input from advisory committees. These statements and actions raise questions about the extent to which key federal health agencies will rely on the advice and input from external vaccine advisory committees going forward.\n\nGiven this context, this brief provides an overview of key federal vaccine advisory committees and discusses policy issues and questions they currently face.\n\nBackground\n\nExternal advisory committees are established by Congress, federal departments, and agencies as tools for “furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions.” Almost all federal external advisory committees are governed by the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), and operate under a common set of rules and guidelines. Each advisory committee under FACA is required to have a charter, which outlines key processes and procedures such as how members are selected, how long members serve, the number of members and voting privileges, meeting schedules, reporting, and other aspects.\n\nExternal advisory committees are typically comprised of the following types of members:\n\nSpecial Government Employee (SGE) members are subject matter experts drawn from outside the U.S. government. SGEs are expected to provide independent input and judgment on behalf of the government and to be free of conflicts of interest – U.S. Code prohibits SGEs from serving on a committee if doing so has a “direct and predictable effect” on their financial interests.\n\n(SGE) members are subject matter experts drawn from outside the U.S. government. SGEs are expected to provide independent input and judgment on behalf of the government and to be free of conflicts of interest – U.S. Code prohibits SGEs from serving on a committee if doing so has a “direct and predictable effect” on their financial interests. Ex-officio members are federal employees who represent relevant federal offices.\n\nmembers are federal employees who represent relevant federal offices. Representative members are individuals from non-government entities that represent points of view from particular groups or interested parties. For example, there may be representatives present on advisory committees from interested professional associations and/or patient groups.\n\nCommittees are overseen by and report to staff from associated federal departments or agencies. For the most part, federal external committees are advisory only – they do not set federal policy and instead only provide input and recommendations for consideration. However, some committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, have certain statutory roles related to federal vaccine programs (see more below).\n\nIn the context of federal vaccine policy, there are four main advisory committees that have been established: the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) at HHS.\n\nVaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)\n\nOverview and governance: The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) at FDA reviews and evaluates scientific data on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and provides independent advice on these issues to the FDA Commissioner. It was initially established in 1979 under U.S. code (21 U.S.C 394) and is subject to the provisions of the FACA. It is managed by the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). Its most recent charter was approved in July 2024; the charter must be renewed every two years or the committee will be terminated, so charter renewal will be due by July 2026.\n\nMembership: There are 15 voting members of VRBPAC, including a Chair. Committee members are selected by the FDA Commissioner from individuals outside the government with expertise in relevant areas and serve for up to four-year terms. One voting member, as selected by the Commissioner or designee, can be selected to represent “consumer interests” while one non-voting member can be selected to represent “industry interests.” There are two ex-officio voting members: one representing the CDC and one representing the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Voting members are subject to FDA and federal government conflict of interest standards and safeguards.\n\nResponsibilities and process: According to its current charter, VRBPAC is meant to be convened approximately six times a year, with meetings open to the public except as determined by the FDA Commissioner or their designee. Each VRBPAC meeting is announced in advance, with an agenda of topics for review by committee members. Typically, the committee is convened to consider one or more candidate vaccines under review by the FDA, which can be new vaccines or updates to existing vaccines. Committee members review background materials and receive presentations that summarize information on the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine(s). There is time allotted for questions and deliberation, including public comments and questions. Voting members are typically asked to vote on specific questions, such as whether the candidate vaccine should or should not be approved by the FDA. The vote results and other information from the meeting are then reviewed and considered by FDA staff and the Commissioner as they make final decisions regarding vaccine approval or authorization, but the FDA Commissioner is not required to follow the recommendations of the committee.\n\nRecent and upcoming meetings & topics: In 2024, the committee met four times. Since taking office, the Trump Administration has convened one VRBPAC meeting, which was held May 22, 2025 and focused on formula selection for COVID-19 vaccines for the 2025-2026 season. Earlier this year, there had been a VRBPAC meeting scheduled for March to review influenza vaccine composition for the 2025-2026 season, but it was cancelled with no reason given. Instead, FDA announced it held a closed-door interagency meeting of government experts to discuss this topic and that group agreed on a set of recommendations for influenza vaccine composition for the coming season without external input from VRBPAC.\n\nAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)\n\nOverview and governance: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides the CDC Director with expert opinion and recommendations about the use of vaccines. ACIP was initially established in 1964 under Section 305a of the Public Health Service Act, and has a Secretariat composed of CDC staff, including an Executive Secretary from the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) who is responsible for overall management and compliance with federal law. The ACIP Secretariat is responsible for renewing the charter every two years (or the committee will be terminated), and any revisions to the charter are subject to review and approval by the Secretary of HHS. The current ACIP charter was approved in April 2024, with renewal due by April 2026.\n\nMembership: There are up to 19 voting members of ACIP including a Chair and Vice Chair; currently, there are 16 voting members serving. Committee members are selected from technically qualified people from outside government trained in a clinical medical field with knowledge of vaccines and immunization. ACIP must include a consumer representative as one of the voting members of the committee. ACIP members are selected by the Secretary of HHS and serve for up to four year terms. Voting members are considered SGEs subject to federal government conflict of interest standards and safeguards. In addition, ACIP voting members cannot be directly employed (or have an immediate family member who is directly employed) by a vaccine manufacturer and cannot hold a patent on a vaccine or related product. Further, members disclose sources of research funding at the beginning of every committee meeting and cannot vote on decisions where they are conflicted. ACIP also has six ex-officio members who are non-voting representatives from related U.S. government agencies such the FDA, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. In addition, there are 31 liaison (non-voting) representatives primarily representing professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians.\n\nResponsibilities and process: ACIP responsibilities include generating recommendations for the CDC Director regarding who should get a vaccine (e.g., specifying age or other criteria), what dose of the vaccine should be given, and what the timing of vaccine doses should be. In addition to generating recommendations for the CDC Director, ACIP also has certain statutory roles assigned by Congress. For example, ACIP has the responsibility to establish the list of vaccines, number of doses, schedule and contraindications for the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or guardians may not be able to afford them. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and subsequent laws have indicated that health insurance plans must cover ACIP-recommended immunizations after those recommendations have been formally adopted by the CDC Director. ACIP also recommends which vaccines are required for individuals immigrating to the United States.\n\nAccording to its charter, ACIP holds three regular meetings each year, though additional meetings may be scheduled as needed. Meetings are open to the public, except as otherwise determined by the CDC Director or their designee. The ACIP Steering Committee, which is comprised of representatives from each of the major centers at CDC, plans the agenda for ACIP meetings. Before meetings, each new or modified use of an existing vaccine on the agenda is reviewed by a work group consisting of ACIP members and CDC staff, which then proposes questions for consideration by the full committee. During meetings the full committee reviews this and other background information, listens to presentations, and engages in discussion and debate. In its deliberations, ACIP considers disease epidemiology and burden of disease, efficacy and effectiveness, safety, the quality of evidence reviewed, economic analyses, and implementation issues for each vaccine. The committee then votes on specific proposals or the wording of recommendations, the results of which are submitted to the CDC Director for consideration, but the CDC Director is not required to follow these recommendations.\n\nRecent and upcoming meetings & topics: A February 2025 ACIP meeting was initially postponed and subsequently held in April 2025. That meeting covered topics that included meningococcal, respiratory syncytial virus, and chikungunya vaccines. There is another ACIP meeting scheduled for June 2025, which is expected to focus on COVID-19 vaccines for the 2025-2026 season, coming after the May 22 VRBPAC meeting on that topic. The June meeting also comes on the heels of an announcement by HHS Secretary Kennedy on May 27 that the CDC will no longer recommend COVID vaccines for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, a policy change that was reported to be a surprise to CDC staff and which was made without any input from ACIP.\n\nNational Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC)\n\nOverview and Governance: The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) serves an advisory role, providing peer review, consultation, advice, and recommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS, in their capacity as the Director of the National Vaccine Program. A senior staff member of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy (OIDP) with the Assistant Secretary of Health at HHS serves as the federal officer responsible for NVAC. The committee was established in 1986 under Section 2105 of the Public Health Service Act, and its charter was renewed in July 2023 and is due for renewal every two years or will be terminated; its next renewal would be July 2025.\n\nMembership: NVAC consists of 17 voting members, comprised of 15 public members who are SGs, including the chair, and two members designated to serve as official representatives of the vaccine manufacturing industry. The committee also includes non-voting ex-officio representatives from federal agencies, as well as non-voting liaison representatives from other groups such as state and local health departments or non-governmental public health organizations. Members are appointed by the Assistant Secretary of Health at HHS in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences; vaccine industry groups are consulted for selection of the two voting representative members.\n\nResponsibilities and process: NVAC advises the Assistant Secretary for Health at HHS on how to close gaps in immunization coverage and makes recommendations for how the U.S. vaccine enterprise broadly can improve the prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination. The committee’s advice and recommendations cover areas such as: barriers in the immunization delivery system, public trust in vaccines, immunization infrastructure, support for providers of immunization services, demand for immunization, vaccine safety, and fostering vaccine development and innovation. NVAC’s advice is presented to the Assistant Secretary for Health, who by law serves as the Director of the U.S. National Vaccine Program. NVAC is the only federal advisory committee that considers and makes recommendations across the entire U.S. immunization system broadly.\n\nAccording to its charter, NVAC meets three times per year, and meetings are open to the public except as otherwise determined by the HHS Secretary or their designee. Meetings can cover recent and timely topics affecting the vaccines and immunizations broadly in the U.S.\n\nRecent and upcoming meetings & topics: NVAC has not met since September 2024. At that meeting, the committee focused on areas such as Hepatitis B vaccine recommendations and implementation, approaches to equity in immunizations, provider payments for vaccination, and a review of HIV vaccine development. No NVAC meetings have been held under the Trump administration, and none have been publicly scheduled for future dates.\n\nAdvisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV)\n\nOverview and Governance: The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) advises the Secretary of HHS on matters related to the implementation of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP). VICP is a federal program established by Congress in 1986, that provides financial compensation to individuals found to have been injured by a vaccine covered by the program (primarily childhood vaccines). The ACCV was established in 1986 under Title 42 of U.S. Code (42 U.S.C. 300aa-19). The committee is managed by the Health Systems Bureau of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The current AACV charter was renewed in July of 2024; the charter is meant to be renewed every two years or will be terminated; the next renewal would be before July 2026.\n\nMembership: Nine voting members appointed by the Secretary as follows: “three health professionals who are not employees of the federal government with expertise in health care of children, the prevention of childhood diseases, and the adverse reactions associated with vaccines, of whom at least two are pediatricians; three members from the general public, of whom at least two shall be legal representatives of children who have suffered a vaccine-related injury or death; and three attorneys, of whom at least one is an attorney whose specialty includes representation of persons who have suffered a vaccine-related injury or death and one who is an attorney whose specialty includes representation of vaccine manufacturers.” Voting members are considered SGEs. In addition, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the Assistant Secretary for Health, the Director of the CDC, and the FDA Commissioner (or designees of these officials) participate as ex-officio, non-voting members.\n\nResponsibilities and process: According to its charter, ACCV is meant to meet four times a calendar year to advise the Secretary of HHS on matters related to the implementation of the VICP. The committee does not make final decisions about individual claims (the United States Court of Federal Claims is responsible for resolving claims for compensation under the VICP) but instead makes observations about and recommendations for improvements to the VICP program. Meetings are open to the public, except as determined otherwise by the Secretary of HHS or their designee.\n\nRecent and upcoming meetings & topics: The most recent ACCV meeting took place in July 2024, where the committee reviewed and discussed topics such as the finding from a National Academy of Medicine review of the adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccination, the latest information from CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and updates from other federal agencies on vaccine injury information. No meetings of ACCV have been held under the Trump administration, and none have been publicly scheduled for future dates. An ACCV meeting that had been scheduled for January 29, 2025 was postponed indefinitely.\n\nIssues to Watch\n\nCommittee composition and membership. To date, no direct action has been taken to remove current members of these external vaccine committees, but officials have voiced an intention to do so. While FDA Commissioner Makary said he had no plans to rearrange or remove experts on FDA external advisory committees such as VRBPAC, Secretary Kennedy, who has the authority to remove members, continues to raise concerns about corruption at FDA and the committee members’ independence. According to reports, Kennedy also says he plans to remove some or all current members of ACIP based on conflict of interest concerns (more below) even though he stated during his confirmation hearings he would “maintain the [ACIP] without changes.”\n\nHandling of alleged conflict of interests. The primary concerns expressed by Secretary Kennedy and others in relation to external advisory committees – especially VRBPAC and ACIP – revolves around accusations of conflicts of interest. Commissioner Makary, for example, has said the FDA under his leadership will have to “review the ethics policy” because of a “cozy relationship between industry and the regulators.” Regarding ACIP, one of the first steps Kennedy took to address transparency concerns was launching a new online tool to allow the public to search for conflicts of interest among ACIP committee members. However, there is little evidence of major conflicts of interest for current VRBPAC and ACIP committee members, and all federal vaccine advisory committee members are already required to comply with federal regulations regarding disclosing potential conflicts of interest. For example, FDA says it “screens all advisory committee members carefully” for current financial interests and any other interests and relationships that could create the appearance that a member lacks impartiality.” In addition, VRBPAC members cannot be directly employed (or have an immediate family member who is directly employed) by a vaccine manufacturer and cannot hold a patent on a vaccine or related product. Likewise, ACIP members file annual financial disclosures, cannot work for or own vaccine manufacturer stock (nor can their family members), and cannot accept gifts from vaccine companies. Even so, more changes to these committees may be coming in the future based on perceived conflicts of interest.\n\nUncertainty about meeting frequency and cancelations. Under the Trump administration, the pace of convenings for these committees has been relatively slow compared to the recommended frequencies noted in their charters, and compared to past years. For example, VRBPAC has met once since President Trump took office this year, even though the frequency has been four to six meetings in previous years. A VRBPAC meeting initially scheduled for March 2025 was cancelled, and a February 2025 ACIP meeting was postponed for over a month. No meetings have been scheduled for either NVAC or ACCV, which according to their charters are meant to have three and four meetings a year, respectively. NVAC, for example, met at least twice and usually three times in each of the previous six years, while ACCV met four times a year over that time frame.\n\nOfficials bypassing or ignoring committee input on key policy decisions. In the past, FDA and CDC have typically sought input from VRBPAC and ACIP when considering key vaccine policy questions. Furthermore, final policy decisions coming from these agencies regarding vaccine approvals and recommendations have typically aligned with the input provided by these committees. However, this year has seen Trump administration health officials make several vaccine policy changes without seeking committee input or doing so while ignoring committee recommendations. For example, seasonal influenza vaccine composition this year was decided without external input, in contrast to previous years. Also, FDA leaders announced that updated COVID-19 vaccines would have to undergo new placebo-controlled trials to be approved in some cases, without any input on this change from VRBPAC. In addition, HHS Secretary Kennedy recently announced CDC would no longer be recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women, a change that was instituted without ACIP consultation and which goes against existing committee recommendations. Further, Kennedy has thus far not acted on issuing new CDC guidance expanding the recommended age range for meningitis and respiratory syncytial virus vaccinations in the U.S., even though these changes were recommended by ACIP in its April 2025 meeting (CDC guidance regarding the chikungunya vaccine, however, was updated following ACIP recommendations from the same meeting). While there is past precedent for FDA and CDC ignoring or breaking with advisory committee recommendations, it has been rare. Ultimately, the leadership of these agencies has authority to take unilateral action, and in fact the Secretary of HHS has ultimate authority over vaccine approvals and recommendations. Therefore, further changes to federal vaccine policy changes that bypass or ignore these committees may be coming.",

    "text": "Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, January 20, 2025\n\nPurpose: Initial rescissions of Executive Orders and Actions issued by President Biden. Among these orders are several that addressed LGBTQ+ equity including “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation” (Executive Order 13988) and “Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals” (Executive Order 14075). The order establishing the White House Gender Policy Council (Executive Order 14020) and several Orders related to diversity, equity, and inclusion were also rescinded, as were orders related to nondiscrimination and equity in schools. Implications: This order could lead to less oversight, reduced health programing, and fewer policies protecting LGBTQ+ people, which could negatively impact access to care and well-being. Of particular note: Rescinds orders that had called for LGBTQ+ people’s health equity, the national public health needs of LGBTQ+ people, LGBTQ+ data collection, and nondiscrimination protections, including in health care.\n\nRescinds orders that had called for nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ+ young people in school, which could contribute to stigma and worsened mental health.\n\nDefending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to The Federal Government, January 20, 2025\n\nPurpose: To define sex as an immutable binary biological classification and remove recognition of the concept of gender identity, including in sex protections and in agency operations. The order states that “It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female” and directs the Executive Branch to “enforce all sex-protective laws to promote this reality”. Elements of the order that may affect LGBTQ people’s health are as follows: Defines sex as “an individual’s immutable biological classification as either male or female.” States that “’sex’ is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of ‘gender identity’” and that gender identity “does not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.”\n\nDefines male and female based on reproductive cell production.\n\nIntroduces the term “gender ideology” which is defined to inlcude “the idea that there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex” and “maintains that it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.”\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide the U.S. government, external partners, and the public guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in the order within 30 days.\n\nDirects each agency and all federal employees to “enforce laws governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities, and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically distinct sexes,” including “when interpreting or applying statutes, regulations, or guidance and in all other official agency business, documents, and communications.”\n\nDirects each agency and all Federal employees, “when administering or enforcing sex-based distinctions,” to “use the term ‘sex’ and not ‘gender’ in all applicable Federal policies and documents.”\n\nDirects agencies to “remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology, and shall cease issuing such statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications or other messages.” Directs agency forms to exclude gender identity and directs agencies to “take all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology.”\n\nRequires that federal funds “not be used to promote gender ideology” and directs agencies to ensure “grant funds do not promote gender ideology.”\n\nDirects the Attorney General to ensure the Bureau of Prisons revises policies to prohibit federal funds from being expended “for any medical procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an inmate’s appearance to that of the opposite sex.”\n\nRescinds multiple executive orders issued by President Biden, including: “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation” (13988), “Establishment of the White House Gender Policy Council” (14020) (which is also dissolved), and “Advancing Equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Individuals” (14075).\n\nAlso directs agencies to rescind certain guidance documents, including, “The White House Toolkit on Transgender Equality”; “The Attorney General’s Memorandum of March 26, 2021 entitled “Application of Bostock v. Clayton County to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,″” and range of orders related to LGBTQ+ students in schools. Implications: This order is broad, directed to all federal agencies and programs. Because federal health programs reach LGBTQ+ people, and some are specifically designed to be inclusive of the LGBTQ+ community, or account for gender identities in addition to biological sex, this Order could widely affect program funding, guidance, and access. It has several possible implications: The terms used in the Order include several biological and social inaccuracies which could perpetuate misinformation about LGBTQ+ people and transgender people’s health needs. It also takes steps towards ban gender care in certain area, most explicitly in prisons. Requiring that federal funds are not used to “promote gender ideology” has caused significant confusion. Since this order was issued, there have been multiple reports of HIV programs and community health centers that have lost funding as a result of supporting programs inclusive of transgender people. In addition, there have been reports that some health care facilities paused providing youth with gender affirming care, fearing that federal funding would be withheld according to this and another Order relating to youth access to gender affirming care (see separate entry). (See court decisions below.) Withholding care could lead to negative health outcomes for those that require it. Data collection and data presentation/distribution have been impacted. At first some data was removed from federal websites, though due to court order this appears to have been restored. If public health messaging and services related to the health needs of transgender people, or other specific populations, are unavailable, this may result in adverse health outcomes such increased disease prevalence, greater difficulty with care engagement, and poor mental health outcomes. There have been reports that gender identity questions will be removed from federal surveys which makes tracking the experiences and well-being of LGBTQ+ people more difficult. The order directs the HHS Secretary to take action to end gender affirming care through Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the law’s major nondiscrimination provision, which includes protections on the basis of sex. While the Biden administration interpreted sex protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity, it is expected that the Trump administration will seek to remove these protections, as was the approach during his first term. Despite the Executive Orders and any future guidance, courts could continue to rule that such protections exist in statute. On March 17th the VA announced that it would phase out providing gender affirming care to comply with this Executive Order. Exceptions include Veterans already receiving hormone therapy from the VA or Veterans “receiving such care from the military as part of and upon their separation from military service” who are eligible for VA health care. The VA will not provide other gender affirming medical services. The statement writes that historically the VA had provided a range of gender affirming services and “letters of support encouraging non-VA providers to perform sex-change surgeries on Veterans.” These services had been authorized under the now rescinded Veterans Health Administration Directive 1341(4). There have been multiple legal challenges to this Order with some judicial actions that have paused aspects of implementation: On February 4, 2025 a lawsuit was filed in federal court challenging the Order on the grounds that it usurps Congressional power, violates Sec. 1557 of the ACA, and is unconstitutional and on February 11 a temporary restraining order and memorandum opinion was issued requiring restoration of webpages, datasets, and any other resources needed to provide medical care, identified by the Plaintiffs.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, a separate federal lawsuit was filed challenging this Order and the Executive Order on “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation” (see separate entry), asserting they are openly discriminatory, unlawful, and unconstitutional. On February 13, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the federal government from withholding or conditioning funding on the basis of providing this care.\n\ntemporary restraining order An additional suit was filed on February 19, 2025 by the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago challenging three Executive Orders: “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing”, “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” as usurping the power of Congress, violating the Constitution and the Administrative Procedures Act, and, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ+ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nOn February 20, a separate case was filed in federal court by multiple LGBTQ+ health care and service organizations, challenging the “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing”, “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” Orders claiming they usurp the power of Congress and violate the Constitution. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nOn March 12, 2025 two physician and academic plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the Order and related OPM memo when their articles were removed from HHS’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)’s Patient Safety Network (PSNet), a federal online patient-safety resource. The reason for the removal articles was for their inclusion of passing references to transgender patients. On May 23, a MA district court found the plaintiffs would likely succeed on their constitutional 1st amendment claims and granted a preliminary injunction requiring HHS to republish the censored content.\n\nEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, January 20, 2025\n\nPurpose: To limit diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) activities in government and by government contractors and grantees. Directs each agency, department, or commission head to take the following actions (among others): terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and “environmental justice” offices and positions…; all “equity action plans,” “equity” actions, initiatives, or programs, “equity-related” grants or contracts…\n\nprovide the Director of the OMB with a list of all “federal grantees who received Federal funding to provide or advance DEI, DEIA, or “environmental justice” programs, services, or activities since January 20, 2021,” among other actions. Implications: As with the other DEIA related Order (see separate entry), these efforts could make reaching populations with unique health needs in culturally competent ways more challenging, including in programs related to LGBTQ+ health and HIV. It could also jeopardized programs and funding for agencies reaching these communities.\n\nAs with the other DEIA related Order (see separate entry), these efforts could make reaching populations with unique health needs in culturally competent ways more challenging, including in programs related to LGBTQ+ health and HIV. It could also jeopardized programs and funding for agencies reaching these communities. There have been multiple legal challenges to this Order:\n\nOn February 3, a lawsuit was filed by four diverse plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of this Order and the Order, “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity”.\n\nAn additional suit was filed in federal court on February 19, 2025 by the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago challenging this order as well as the “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” ” as usurping the power of Congress, violating the Constitution and the Administrative Procedures Act, and, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nOn February 20, a separate case was filed in federal court by multiple LGBTQ+ health care and service organizations, challenging the “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing”, “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” orders claiming they usurp the power of Congress and violate the Constitution. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity, January 21, 2025\n\nPurpose: Order seeks to end federal “preferencing” through DEIA efforts within government and through contracting to the extent that they do not comply with the Administration’s view of civil rights law. The order is broad and non-specific but includes the following directives: Orders all executive departments and agencies “to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.”\n\nOrders agency heads to include in every contract or grant award “a term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and…A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” Implications: As with the other DEIA related Order (see separate entry), these efforts could make reaching populations with unique health needs in culturally competent ways more challenging, including in programs related to LGBTQ+ health and HIV. It could also jeopardized programs and funding for agencies reaching these communities. There have been multiple legal challenges to this Order: On February 3, a lawsuit was filed by four diverse plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of this and the “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” Order.\n\nAn additional suit was filed in federal court on February 19, 2025 by the National Urban League, National Fair Housing Alliance, and AIDS Foundation of Chicago challenging this order as well as the “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing” as usurping the power of Congress, violating the Constitution and the Administrative Procedures Act, and, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nOn February 20, a separate case was filed in federal court by multiple LGBTQ+ health care and service organizations, challenging the “Ending Radical and Wasteful DEI Programs and Preferencing”, “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and the “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” orders claiming they usurp the power of Congress and violate the Constitution. In their complaint, plaintiffs highlight the potential harm this Order could bring to people with HIV and LGBTQ communities and the programs that serve them.\n\nProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation, January 28, 2025\n\nPurpose: Order directs agencies and programs to work towards significantly limiting access to gender affirming care for young people (defined as those under age 19) nationwide. Directs agencies to rescind and amend policies that rely on guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).\n\nDirects the HHS Secretary to conduct and publish a review of existing literature and best practices related to gender affirming care and gender dysphoria and to “increase the quality of data to guide practices“ in this area.\n\nDirects executive department and agency heads “that provide research or education grants to medical institutions, including medical schools and hospitals”, “in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget” to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children” (which is how the Order defines gender affirming care).\n\nDirects the HHS Secretary to take action to end gender affirming care for children “including [through] regulatory and sub-regulatory actions, which may involve the following laws, programs, issues, or documents: Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage clinical-abuse or inappropriate-use assessments relevant to State Medicaid programs mandatory drug use reviews section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act quality, safety, and oversight memoranda essential health benefits requirements; and the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and other federally funded manuals, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.”\n\nWithdraws Biden Administration “HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights and Patient Privacy” and directs the Secretary of HHS “in consultation with the Attorney General [to] issue new guidance protecting whistleblowers who take action related to ensuring compliance with this order.”\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Department of Defense to “commence a rulemaking or sub-regulatory action” restrict access to gender affirming care for children in the TRICARE program.\n\nDirects the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to limit access to care in coverage for federal employees’ families by requiring “provisions in the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and Postal Service Health Benefits (PSHB) programs call letter for the 2026 Plan Year” that would require eligible carriers to exclude “coverage for pediatric transgender surgeries or hormone treatments…”\n\nDirects the Attorney General to review Department of Justice laws on female genital mutilation and “prioritize enforcement of protections” and “to convene States’ Attorneys General and other law enforcement officers to coordinate the enforcement of laws against female genital mutilation.”\n\nDirects the Attorney General to “prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end deception of consumers, fraud, and violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by any entity that may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation.”\n\nDirects the Attorney General “in consultation with the Congress” “to draft, propose, and promote legislation to enact a private right of action for children and the parents” who have received gender affirming care “which should include a lengthy statute of limitations.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to “prioritize investigations and take appropriate action to end child-abusive practices by so-called sanctuary States that facilitate stripping custody from parents who support the healthy development of their own children, including by considering the application of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and recognized constitutional rights.”\n\nDirects agency heads included in this executive order to “submit a single, combined report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, detailing progress in implementing this order and a timeline for future action” within 60 Days of its issuance. Implications: If fully implemented, the Order would broadly and extensively limit access to gender affirming care for young people, across a range of payers and providers. Access to gender affirming care is associated with improved mental health outcomes for transgender people and limiting this care with negative ones, including poorer mental health outcomes. Additional impact includes: The executive order includes details about sex, gender identity, gender affirming care, and transgender people that conflict with science and evidence. These inaccuracies include suggesting that large shares of youth are seeking gender affirming medical care, that regret rates among those seeking care are high, and conflating “female genital mutilation” and gender-affirming care. This has the potential to promote hostility, stigma, and discrimination, and can lead to care denials.\n\nIt seeks to remove Federal reference to one of the standards of evidence-based care for transgender people in the US. Directing the HHS Secretary to develop new guidance without this standard, and in accordance with this and other orders, could limit agency ability to identify standards that adequately meet the needs of transgender people.\n\nIt also seeks to condition federal research and education grants on grantees not providing young people with gender affirming care.\n\nThere has already been some confusion with certain states and providers looking to preemptively comply with the order and another Order relating to “gender ideology” (see separate entry).\n\nThe order lays groundwork for the Administration remove explicit protects for LGBTQ+ people in health care, including with respect to accessing gender affirming care. Specifically, the Order suggests a reinterpretation of sex protections in Section. 1557 of the Affordable Care Act void of explicit protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe order leans on laws and policies unrelated to gender affirming care in an effort to limit access to those services including by erroneously conflating gender affirming care and female genital mutilation, using the FDA regulatory process to limit access, and suggesting kidnapping protections be applied to parents in certain circumstance. On February 19, 2025, additional guidance was released relating to this order, providing new and refined definition of terms “ which directs the Department of Health and Human Services (the Department) to promulgate clear guidance to the U.S. Government, external partners, and the public, expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in the Executive Order.” On February 20, 2025, pursuant to this Order, HHS issued a “Recession of ‘HHS Notice and Guidance on Gender Affirming Care, Civil Rights, and Patient Privacy’ issued by the Biden Administration” which had stated the Administration “stands with transgender and gender nonconforming youth” and that medically necessary for gender affirming care for minors improves physical and mental health. It also reiterated that administration’s view that Sec. 1557 of the ACA includes protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. There have been multiple legal challenges to this Order with some judicial actions that have paused aspects of implementation: On February 4, 2025, a federal lawsuit was filed challenging this Order and the Executive Order on “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to The Federal Government,” asserting they are openly discriminatory, unlawful, and unconstitutional. On February 13, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the federal government from withholding or conditioning funding on the basis of providing this care. On March 4th, the court issued a preliminary temporary injunction.\n\nAn additional federal lawsuit was filed on February 7 th challenging this executive order with a separate temporary restraining order being issued on the 14th preventing the conditioning of federal funds and also applying to a condition linking gender affirming care to female genital mutilation. The restraining order was extended through March 5th on February 26th. On June 1, the FBI posted on social media urging the public to “report tips of any hospitals, clinics, or practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children,” despite pediatric gender affirming care being permitted in about half of states and not prohibited by the federal government.\n\nEnding Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling, January 29, 2025\n\nPurpose: Directs agency heads in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop an “Ending Indoctrination Strategy” aimed at ensuring federal funds do not fund or support “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology.” Directs the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of HHS, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop an “Ending Indoctrination Strategy” within 90 days. Among other requirements, the strategy must include agency processes for preventing or rescinding Federal funds from being used by K-12 schools to: “support or subsidize the instruction, advancement, or promotion of gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology in” curriculum, instruction, programs, or activities teacher certification, licensing, employment, or training. “directly or indirectly support or subsidize the social transition of a minor student including through school staff or teachers” “deliberately concealing the minor’s social transition from the minor’s parents.”\n\nImplications: Should the federal government proceed with conditioning federal funding for schools on whether or not they support transgender students, it could exacerbate existing mental health disparities, contribute to stigma and discrimination, and reduce school connectedness. For example, the policies detailed in the Order could prevent schools from recognizing transgender students’ identities (e.g. their names and pronouns), allow schools to withhold mental health services, to out students to (potentially unsupportive) families, and to restrict facility use and activity participation.\n\nMemorandum For The Heads Of Executive Departments And Agencies, February 6, 2025\n\nPurpose: The memorandum seeks to “stop funding Nongovernmental Organizations that undermine the national interest and administration priorities.” The memorandum states: It is Administration policy “to stop funding [Nongovernmental Organizations] NGOs that undermine the national interest.”\n\nDirect heads of executive departments and agencies to review all funding that agencies provide to NGOs and “to align future funding decisions with the interests of the United States and with the goals and priorities of my Administration, as expressed in executive actions; as otherwise determined in the judgment of the heads of agencies; and on the basis of applicable authorizing statutes, regulations, and terms.” Implications: This memo aligns with other administrative efforts to stop current and future funding from being provided to NGOs that do not align with administrative priorities and could impact funding to health organizations or programs aimed at serving transgender people or research funding inclusive of trans and gender diverse people. It could also potentially impact care for LGBTQ+ people more broadly if services aimed directly at this population are considered DEIA efforts.\n\nDOJ Letter to the Supreme Court: United States v. Jonathan Skrmetti, Attorney, February 7, 2025\n\nPurpose: “To notify the Court that the government’s previously stated views” on a case challenging a state’s ban on gender affirming care “no longer represents the United States’ position.” Notifies the Court that “following the change in Administration, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the United States’ position in” the case brought by the Biden Administration challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care for minors. The letter states, that their view is that the Tennessee law being challenged “does not deny equal protection on account of sex or any other characteristic,” which is the question before the Court.\n\nDespite this change in perspective, the Trump Administration encouraged the Court to resolve the questions presented without granting certiorari to the original plaintiffs. Implications: There are 26 states with bans on gender affirming care for minors and litigation challenging these bans is ongoing. At the request of the Biden Administration, who brought the plaintiff’s case from the lower courts, the Supreme Court agreed to examine whether the Tennessee ban violates Equal Protection constitutional protections under the 14th Amendment. The case was briefed and argued prior to the administration change. Upon taking office, the Trump Administration wrote this letter to the Court stating that the Biden Administration position no longer represented that of the U.S. government but nevertheless asked the court to decide the case. The court will likely issue a decision in the case and technically, the Trump Administration letter should not have bearing on the court’s decision. The court is expected to issue a decision in the case this summer (2025).\n\nQuality and Safety Special Alert Memo on Provision of Gender Affirming Care to Children, March 5, 2025\n\nPurpose: To alert providers to the administration’s approach to children’s access to gender affirming care and serve as notice “that CMS may begin taking steps in the future to align policy, including CMS-regulated provider requirements and agreements…” to limit such care. The memorandum states: That “CMS renews its commitment to promoting evidence-based standards through health quality and safety improvement activities, and reminds hospitals and other applicable facilities and providers of the obligation to prioritize the health and safety of their patients, especially children.” It questions evidence around gender affirming care for young people and states “CMS may begin taking steps in the future to adjust its policies to reflect this…” Implications: The CMS memo aligns with policies put forward in the Executive Order, “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” related to limiting young people’s access to gender affirming care, provisions of which are subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction (described in above entry). However, this is not explicitly stated in the memo.\n\nOn March 6 th the Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released additional guidance stating that they would review policies, grants, and programs for consistency with the CMS memo (SAMHSA letter unavailable but described in this filing). HRSA also specifically notes the agency will review its Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program for consistency with the memo.\n\nthe Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released additional guidance stating that they would review policies, grants, and programs for consistency with the CMS memo (SAMHSA letter unavailable but described in this filing). HRSA also specifically notes the agency will review its Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) Payment Program for consistency with the memo. While the memo does not specifically refer to the Executive Order, on March 7 th , plaintiffs in a case challenging the order sought enforcement of the preliminary injunction claiming that the CMS memo and HRSA/SAMHSA guidance violate its terms because by “threatening to withhold federal funding, the Executive Orders coerced hospitals into immediately shutting down gender affirming medical care for people under nineteen to avoid potential loss of funds.”\n\n, plaintiffs in a case challenging the order sought enforcement of the preliminary injunction claiming that the CMS memo and HRSA/SAMHSA guidance violate its terms because by “threatening to withhold federal funding, the Executive Orders coerced hospitals into immediately shutting down gender affirming medical care for people under nineteen to avoid potential loss of funds.” Depending on how future policy is implemented, CMS could seek to significantly limit access to gender affirming care for young people.\n\nPurpose: The rule would prohibit gender affirming care services from being covered as an Essential Health Benefit (EHB) in ACA plans, among other activities. Among a range of other proposals, CMS seeks to change how ACA complaint individual and small group plans would cover gender affirming care services, which the rule calls “coverage for sex-trait modification.” Proposes, beginning plan year 2026, to prohibit insurers from covering gender affirming care as an essential health benefit (EHB). Implications: The aim of the proposed rule aligns with policies expressed in Executive Orders on genderand limiting access to gender affirming care (discussed above), though the agency clarifies the rule does not rely on the enjoined sections of those orders.\n\nUnder the proposal enrollees would not be assured the same cost-sharing and benefit design protections as for services included in the EHB package. Costs accrued for gender affirming care would not be required to count towards deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums, and would not be protected from lifetime limits, increasing out-of-pocket liability.\n\nStates could be faced with defraying the cost of covering these services under certain scenarios. Per the rule, “if any State separately mandates coverage for sex-trait modification outside of its EHB-benchmark plan, the State would be required to defray the cost…”\n\nIf implemented, there could be legal challenges, especially related to the ACA “typicality” requirement, that is that EHBs must be “equal to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan,” and to ACA sex nondiscrimination protections.\n\nNational Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2025, April 3, 2025\n\nPurpose: Issued to proclaim April as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. Describes “the sinister threat of gender ideology” as “one of the most prevalent forms of child abuse facing our country today.” Erroneously conflates youth access to gender affirming care with child abuse.\n\nReferences other efforts (see above) aimed at “prohibiting public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology” and “taking action to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth.”\n\nPromises legal action against those perpetrating child abuse. Implications: The proclamation includes details about gender affirming care and transgender people that conflict with science and evidence, including that children are being “indoctrinated” “with the devastating lie that they are trapped in the wrong body,” referring to gender affirming surgery (which is very rare among young people) as “sexual mutilation surgery,” and suggesting that such care inhibits “happiness, health, and freedom,” for young people and creates “heartbreak” for parents and families.\n\nBy erroneously conflating gender affirming care and abuse, potentially threatens those providing or facilitating access by stating, “we affirm that every perpetrator who inflicts violence on our children will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nRyan White Letter to Awardees and Stakeholders Relating to Gender Affirming Care, April 7, 2025.\n\nPurpose: Reverses a Biden Administration policy that had permitted the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program to cover certain gender affirming care services as a part of whole person care to transgender people with HIV. Referring to a policy on gender affirming care from the Biden administration, the letter states that “under the previous administration, certain interpretations of RWHAP’s allowable uses…co-opted the program’s patient centered mission in favor of radical ideological agendas and policies.”\n\nThe letter further states “that RWHAP funds shall be marshaled exclusively toward evidence-based interventions proven to combat HIV, sustain viral suppression, and improve the quality of life for those living with the disease” and reaffirms the prohibition on funding services outside the scope of outpatient care, including “surgeries and inpatient care, irrespective of setting or anesthesia” Implications: Previously, Ryan White funds were permitted to be used to support gender affirming care within core medical and support service categories, including through the provision of hormones via ADAP programs. Additionally, funds could be used to “provide behavioral and mental health services to clients experiencing gender dysphoria and social and emotional stress related to transgender discrimination, stigma, and rejection.” The policy under the prior Administration prohibited surgery, as does the new one, so that does not represent a change.\n\nProhibiting use of funds to support certain gender affirming care services may make care engagement more challenging for transgender Ryan White clients. In some cases, gender affirming care may have helped to connect clients with HIV services and thus improve HIV outcomes.\n\nPurpose: HHS issued this notice “to clarify the non-enforceability of certain language that was included in the preamble to—but not the regulatory text of” the final rule on Section 504, “titled ‘Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance.’ The clarification states that language in the preamble concerning gender dysphoria, which is not in the regulatory text, does not have the force or effect of law and cannot be enforced. Implications: Section 504 prohibits recipients of federal funding, including publicly-subsidized health payers and health care providers who accept Medicare or Medicaid, from discriminating against people on the basis of disability. The Biden Administration’s final rule on Sec. 504 included in the preamble that HHS would “approach gender dysphoria as it would any other disorder or condition. If a disorder or condition affects one or more body systems, or is a mental or psychological disorder, it may be considered a physical or mental impairment.”\n\nThis new interpretation could weaken certain protections for transgender and gender non-conforming people.\n\nPurpose: “The purpose of this letter is to ensure that state Medicaid agencies are aware of growing evidence regarding certain procedures offered to children, and to remind states of their responsibility to ensure that Medicaid payments are consistent with quality of care and that covered services are provided in a manner consistent with the best interest of recipients.” States that “medical interventions for gender dysphoria in children have proliferated” and that “several developed countries have recently diverged from the U.S. in the way they treat gender dysphoria in children.”\n\nCMS reminds states of the following federal Medicaid requirements: Program “responsibility to ensure that payments are consistent with ‘efficiency, economy, and quality of care.’” Requirement for states to “provide such safeguards as may be necessary to ensure covered care and services are provided in a manner consistent with the best interests of recipients.” Prohibition on “federal funding for coverage of services whose purpose is to permanently render an individual incapable of reproducing. Federal financial participation (FFP) is strictly limited for procedures, treatments, or operations for the purpose of rendering an individual permanently incapable of reproducing and…prohibited for such procedures performed on a person under age 21.” Drug utilization review (DUR) program requirements “to assure that prescribed drugs are appropriate, medically necessary, and are not likely to result in adverse results.” CMS encourages “states to review their DUR programs to ensure alignment with current medical evidence and federal requirements, including the evidence outlined above. Notes that “additional guidance on DUR approaches is forthcoming.”\n\nImplications: Letter appears to encourage states to take steps to limit gender affirming care for youth within their state Medicaid programs and suggests that not doing so could put them out of compliance with federal law. It does not immediately change policy. Letter misrepresents certain information about gender affirming care including its frequency and the approach in international settings. Letter leverages a law aimed at addressing discrimination/unwanted sterilizations among people with disabilities to limit gender affirming care. The letter could lead to changes in state policy-making or make providers and/or employers less likely to cover services which could ultimately lead to more limited access to GAC. CMS issued a press release along with the letter. The letter stated “Medicaid dollars are not to be used for gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments in minors.”\n\n\n\nPurpose: An internal Department of Justice (DOJ) memorandum seeks to implement, in part, an executive order aimed at limiting minor’s access to gender affirming care (GAC) (see above). The memo is an internal document that was leaked. It is not law but provides guidance relating to an earlier executive order aimed at limiting minor access to gender affirming care (see above). The memo reportedly: The internal document was leaked and is not law but provides guidance relating to an earlier executive order aimed at limiting minor access to gender affirming care.\n\nPuts providers “on notice” that “it is a felony to perform, attempt to perform, or conspire to perform female genital mutilation (“FGM”*) on” minors and states that the FBI “alongside federal, state, and local partners, will pursue every legitimate lead on possible FGM cases.”\n\nStates DOJ “will investigate and hold accountable medical providers and pharmaceutical companies that mislead the public about the long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilations.” Directs “investigations of any violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by manufacturers and distributors engaged in misbranding by making false claims about the…use of puberty blockers, sex hormones, or any other drug” in GAC.\n\nDirects “investigations under the False Claims Act of false claims submitted to federal health care programs for any non-covered services related to radical gender experimentation.” Gives example of prescribing puberty blockers to a minor for GAC but reporting the service as being for early onset puberty. States Department will work with whistleblowers “with knowledge of any such violations” under The False Claims Act. Following prior direction “that Department employees shall not rely on”… the World Professional Association for Transgender Health ( WPATH)… “guidelines, and that they should withdraw all court filings” doing so, “expressly extend[s] that direction to all Department employees.” Directs department to “purge all…policies, memoranda, and publications and court filings based on WPATH guidelines.”\n\nWPATH)… “guidelines, and that they should withdraw all court filings” doing so, “expressly extend[s] that direction to all Department employees.” Directs department to “purge all…policies, memoranda, and publications and court filings based on WPATH guidelines.” Launches “the Attorney General’s Coalition Against Child Mutilation” to “partner with state attorneys general to identify leads, share intelligence, and build cases against…” providers “…violating federal or state laws banning female genital mutilation and other, related practices…[and] support the state-level prosecution of medical professionals who violate state laws “prohibiting gender affirming care.\n\nInstructs Office of Legislative Affairs to draft legislation “creating a private right of action for children and the parents of children” who have had gender affirming care with “a long statute of limitations and retroactive liability” and work with Congress “to bring this bill to President Trump.” Implications: The memo directs action but is not law. It seeks to implement an executive order that is, in part, currently enjoined in court.\n\nThe memo includes inaccuracies relating to gender identity, gender affirming care, and transgender people that conflict with science and evidence. These inaccuracies include suggesting that being transgender is a harmful medical condition, that large shares of youth are seeking gender affirming medical care, that regret rates among those seeking care are high, and conflating “female genital mutilation” and gender-affirming care. This has the potential to promote hostility, stigma, and discrimination, and can lead to care denials.\n\nSeeks to discredit WPATH’s widely relied on standard of care guidelines which providers look to deliver best practices gender affirming care and is regularly referenced by major medical associations including the American Psychological Association.\n\nWhile nothing in the memo prohibits provision of gender affirming care, its emphasis on litigation and enforcement of existing law that do not necessarily implicate this care, could have a chilling effect on providers.\n\nHHS Report “Treatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria: Review of Evidence and Best Practices,” May 1, 2025.\n\nPurpose: To develop an evidence review around pediatric gender affirming medical care as commissioned by the executive order on Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation (see above entry). “This Review of evidence and best practices was commissioned pursuant to Executive Order 14187, signed on January 28, 2025. It is not a clinical practice guideline, and it does not issue legislative or policy recommendations. Rather, it seeks to provide the most accurate and current information available regarding the evidence base for the treatment of gender dysphoria in this population, the state of the relevant medical field in the United States, and the ethical considerations associated with the treatments offered. The Review is intended for policymakers, clinicians, therapists, medical organizations and, importantly, patients and their families.” Among the report’s findings: Report concludes that the quality of evidence on the effects of gender affirming intervention is low but also that evidence on harms is “sparse.”\n\nCites “significant risks” of medical transition, departing from most medical associations and widely used guidelines in the U.S.\n\nIn addition to a focus on medical intervention (e.g. surgery, puberty blockers, and hormones) report discusses role of psychotherapy in gender affirming care, supporting the use of psychotherapeutic approaches, including an approach termed “exploratory therapy”, which can include conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is a practice that seeks to change an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity. These practices contrast with recommendations from major medical associations, which criticize conversion efforts for their lack evidence, ineffectiveness, and because they can cause harm. Additionally, many states ban these practices for the same reasons. Implications: Review could be used as support for other actions the administration seeks to take (some described here) aimed at limiting minor access to gender affirming care. Outside experts, including from the American Academy of Pediatrics, have raised concerns that the “report misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care.”\n\nWith respect to therapeutic practices, it could shift how some practitioners approach gender affirming care or potentially provide support to those using conversion related approaches.\n\nThe report could also fuel misinformation in other areas, particularly around regret rates (which the report states are high when they are actually very low) and the share of young people seeking a medical transition (which the report states is large, when the share is small). On May 28, 2025, HHS sent a letter to an unspecified group of providers, state medical boards, and health risk managers urging providers to update treatment protocol to align with the review’s findings and avoid relying on the WPATH Standards of Care (which are seen by gender affirming care providers as valuable and trusted source of guidance.) The letter points to risk but not benefits of gender affirming medical care and highlights the report’s promotion of psychotherapy as an alternative to other medical care.",

    "text": "By GREGORY HOPSON\n\nT-Maître Pierre’s Family Restaurant was a Louisiana institution. The kind of place where generations gathered over steaming mountains of boiled crawfish, spicy corn, and seasoned potatoes. A place where Clifton Chenier’s Louisiana Blues & Zydeco played in the background and the waitstaff wore starched white shirts with bright-colored bow ties. The walls were plastered with faded photos of people smiling. Nobody knew who they were anymore, but they felt like family.\n\nPierre Thibodeaux, the founder, made sure every customer was treated as if they were indeed family. So it was a bit ironic that when he passed away, he had no heirs.\n\nWithin the week, the restaurant was acquired by multi-million-dollar developer O. B. Noxious, who addressed reporters beneath a banner that read:\n\nMAKE CRAWFISH AMAZING AGAIN\n\n“They call these little lobsters crawfish. Very smart. I like that. We’re keeping that name. Everything else? Outdated. Inefficient. Sad. We’re going to take this failing shack and turn it into the greatest restaurant the world has ever seen. People will come from everywhere and say, ‘Wow! I’ve never had crawfish this good. It’s the best anyone has ever tasted.’”\n\nTo oversee the transformation, Noxious brought in Otto Maladore, a consultant known for running billion-dollar companies and doing math in his head (where he also did all of his research).\n\nMaladore spent thirty minutes walking the property, leaning over this, pressing on that, and stepping back from things while shaking his head. It wasn’t long before he issued his report to the press:\n\nExcess Labor: “Wait staff, custodian, dishwasher? None of them cook so we’re wasting money on them. Eliminate all of those positions.”\n\n“Wait staff, custodian, dishwasher? None of them cook so we’re wasting money on them. Eliminate all of those positions.” Menu Simplification: “Boiled crawfish outsells everything. Eliminate everything else. Eliminate the menu itself. Menus are nothing more than administrative bloat.”\n\n“Boiled crawfish outsells everything. Eliminate everything else. Eliminate the menu itself. Menus are nothing more than administrative bloat.” Décor: “We will have the best of everything. Those photos are faded and were low quality when they were new. Remove them.”\n\n“We will have the best of everything. Those photos are faded and were low quality when they were new. Remove them.” IT Modernization: “Found an IBM 5150 still running their books. This fascinates me-and concerns me-on so many different levels.”\n\n“Found an IBM 5150 still running their books. This fascinates me-and concerns me-on so many different levels.” Fixed Costs: “This place is hemorrhaging due to indirect costs. Forty percent of revenue on facilities and administration? That’s insane. Ten percent is more than enough for a place like this! But we’re far more generous and much more compassionate than people give us credit for. So we’re not going to cap it at 10%. We’re going to bump it all the way up to 15%!”\n\nThe changes happened quickly-literally overnight.\n\nThe next day when customers showed up, they found no music. No waiters. No ambiance. Just folding chairs, a beat-up old card table, and flickering fluorescent lights (they were told the remodeling would be done later). The walls were bare except for a sign that read:\n\nT-MAÎTRE PIERRE’S CRAWFISH\n\nREAD CAREFULLY!!!!!!\n\nProceed to the back parking lot and sign in.\n\nYou will be assigned a ten-minute time slot for boiling. You will receive:\n\na. Live crawfish\n\nb. Unshucked corn\n\nc. Potatoes (with high-quality dirt: pH between 6 and 6.5) Boiling pot pre-heated to exactly 212°F.\n\nDO NOT ADD OR REMOVE WATER!!!!!! Spice levels are pre-set. Extra napkins: $0.25 each IMPROPER DISPOSAL OF CORN HUSKS: 10% surcharge Failure to remove crawfish on time results in meal forfeiture.\n\nNO EXCEPTIONS, NO REFUNDS!!!!!\n\nA middle-aged man in a Ragin’ Cajuns hat read the instructions aloud. Then he looked around at the solemn-looking patrons waiting in line behind him. The place was quiet except for a few muffled noises from the kitchen. He removed his cap, looked heavenward, paused, and muttered:\n\n“Mais, ça, c’est pas bon.” (Man, this is no good.)\n\nBy the end of the week, two of the three chefs had had enough of renting pots and pans and arguing over burner rights. They moved to California, where a Chinese restaurant offered a fully equipped kitchen and covered indirect costs. Within weeks, they’d introduced Admiral Pierre’s Crawfish, featuring crawfish imported from China-descendants of Louisiana crawfish accidentally introduced there in the 1930s.\n\nBack in Louisiana, the rain was coming down harder and the lone remaining chef was standing ankle-deep in a puddle, scolding a water-logged customer for being thirty seconds late getting his crawfish into the pot.\n\nThe Moral\n\nThis is what happens when outsiders impose arbitrary cost caps in the name of “efficiency.”\n\nT-Maître Pierre’s didn’t fail because of bad crawfish. It failed because it lost the infrastructure that made the meal possible-pots, burners, tongs, and the people. The chef, once celebrated for his recipes and skill, now stands in the rain, powerless to cook without the tools he depended on. The recipes remain, but customers must now struggle to bridge the gaps themselves, leaving behind the joy and ease of a shared meal.\n\nNIH’s Facilities and Administrative (F&A) cap is no different. It slashes funding for the very essentials that enable research to thrive: lab space, equipment, compliance staff, and the humans who know how to maintain complex machinery like autoclaves. Researchers, once empowered by infrastructure and expertise, are left to watch their innovations stall as benefactors scramble to piece together what’s missing.\n\nAt T-Maître Pierre’s, you’re stranded in the rain, struggling to figure out how to get crawfish boiled properly. And when you ask for help, the chef responds:\n\n“Je suis l’uniq qui reste, pis ça c’est tout ce que j’ai.”\n\n(I’m the only one left and this is all there is.)\n\nUnder NIH’s 15% cap, your research institution is trying to fund an autoclave by tearing its couch apart to find any loose change that may have fallen out of visitors’ pockets. And even that source is drying up-since PayPal and Venmo don’t have loose change.\n\nGregory Hopson works remotely from Baton Rouge, Louisiana as a Business Intelligence Developer for Emory Healthcare in Atlanta, Ga.",

    "text": "By KIM BELLARD\n\nOne of my frequent laments is that here we are, a quarter of the way into the 21st century, yet too much of our health care system still looks like the 20th century, and not enough like the 22nd century. It’s too slow, too reactive, too imprecise, and uses too much brute force. I want a health care system that seems more futuristic, that does things more elegantly.\n\nSo here are three examples of the kinds of things that give me hope, in rough order of when they might be ready for prime time:\n\nFloss sensor: You know you’re supposed to floss every day, right? And you know that your oral health is connected to your overall health, in a number of ways, right? So some smart people at Tufts University thought, hmm, perhaps we can help connect those dots.\n\n“It started in a collaboration with several departments across Tufts, examining how stress and other cognitive states affect problem solving and learning,” said Sameer Sonkusale, professor of electrical and computer engineering. “We didn’t want measurement to create an additional source of stress, so we thought, can we make a sensing device that becomes part of your day-to-day routine? Cortisol is a stress marker found in saliva, so flossing seemed like a natural fit to take a daily sample.”\n\nThe result: “a saliva-sensing dental floss looks just like a common floss pick, with the string stretched across two prongs extending from a flat plastic handle, all about the size of your index finger.”\n\nIt uses a technology called electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (eMIPs) to detect the cortisol. “The eMIP approach is a game changer,” said Professor Sonkusale. “Biosensors have typically been developed using antibodies or other receptors that pick up the molecule of interest. Once a marker is found, a lot of work has to go into bioengineering the receiving molecule attached to the sensor. eMIP does not rely on a lot of investment in making antibodies or receptors. If you discover a new marker for stress or any other disease or condition, you can just create a polymer cast in a very short period of time.”\n\nThe sensor is designed to track rather to diagnose, but the scientists are optimistic that the approach can be used to track other conditions, such as oestrogen for fertility tracking, glucose for diabetes monitoring, or markers for cancer. They also hope to have a sensor that can track multiple conditions, “for more accurate monitoring of stress, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other conditions.”\n\nThey believe that their sensor has comparable accuracy to the best performing sensors currently available, and are working on a start-up to commercialize their approach.\n\nNano-scale biosensor: Flossing is all well and good, but many of us are not as diligent about it as we should be, so, hey, what about sensors inside us that do the tracking without us having to do anything? That’s what a team at Stanford are suggesting in A biochemical sensor with continuous extended stability in vivo, published in Nature.\n\nThe researchers say:\n\nThe development of biosensors that can detect specific analytes continuously, in vivo, in real time has proven difficult due to biofouling, probe degradation and signal drift that often occur in vivo. By drawing inspiration from intestinal mucosa that can protect host cell receptors in the presence of the gut microbiome, we develop a synthetic biosensor that can continuously detect specific target molecules in vivo.\n\n“We needed a material system that could sense the target while protecting the molecular switches, and that’s when I thought, wait, how does biology solve this problem?” said Yihang Chen, the first author of the paper. Their modular biosensor, called the Stable Electrochemical Nanostructured Sensor for Blood In situ Tracking (SENSBIT) system, can survive more than a week in live rats and a month in human serum.\n\n“This work began more than a dozen years ago and we have been steadily advancing this technology,” said Tom Soh, senior author of the paper. “This order-of-magnitude improvement in whole-blood sensor longevity over existing technologies is a huge advancement toward next-generation biosensors.”\n\nThe researchers believe their approach can lead to a new medical paradigm – “one where we can not only detect disease earlier but also potentially tailor treatments in real time.” Amen to that!\n\nIn vivo CAR-T therapies: If you follow cancer treatments, you’re familiar with CAR-T therapies, which engineer immune cells to fight cancer cells. They’re very promising, but very expensive, and time-consuming to make. “This whole process, it’s just inefficient,” Saar Gill, a haematologist and oncologist also at the Perelman School of Medicine, told Cassandra Willyard in Nature. “If I’ve got a patient with cancer, I can prescribe chemotherapy and they’ll get it tomorrow.”\n\nMs. Willyard profiles the approach of engineering the CAR-T cells in vivo. The potential, she reports, is enormous: “Treatments that deliver a gene for the CAR protein to cells in the blood could be mass produced and available on demand — theoretically, at a much lower price than current CAR-T therapies. A single dose of commercial CAR-T therapy costs around $500,000. A vial of in vivo treatment might cost an order of magnitude less.”\n\n“If it’s efficacious and safe, it could really challenge the current paradigm,” Joseph McGuirk, a haematologist and oncologist who studies cellular therapies at the University of Kansas Medical Center, told her. And “we need to challenge the current paradigm”.\n\nObviously, this is not simple. “The stumbling block is, how do you get it to the right cell, the right place, right time?” said Michel Sadelain, a genetic engineer and director of the Columbia Initiative in Cell Engineering and Therapy at Columbia University. Ms. Willard describes different approaches that different companies are trying to accomplish this. Some companies, for example, are using viral vectors, while others use nanoparticles to deliver RNA into T cells. Other companies are skipping T cells and inserting the RNA into macrophages and other immune cells.\n\nHuman trials are underway, although with small numbers of participants. “I think 2025 and 2026 are going to be two very busy years in this area,” one CEO told Ms. Willyard. Let’s hope so.\n\n———–\n\nEach of these is promising, and certainly in the right direction. Add these to, say, 3D printing in vivo using sound or programming smart cells, and forgive me if I get excited. We’re seeing glimpses of the future.\n\nSo next time someone wants to stick a needle in you for a blood test, put you through a colonoscopy, or start you on a grueling chemotherapy regime, ask yourself: would I be doing this in the 22nd century?\n\nKim is a former emarketing exec at a major Blues plan, editor of the late & lamented Tincture.io, and now regular THCB contributor",

    "text": "By DANIEL STONE\n\nJoe Biden’s metastatic cancer diagnosis brings together two controversial issues: PSA testing for prostate cancer and presidential politics. To understand what is at stake Americans need basic information about PSA testing, and a frank discussion of the reasoning behind the prostate cancer screening decisions in the former president’s case. The dribble of information we’ve gotten only creates more uncomfortable questions for Biden and his family. The absence of adequate explanation also fails to contribute to public appreciation of these important medical issues.\n\nThe prostate, a walnut-shaped gland at the base of the bladder, produces “prostate specific antigen,” or PSA. Chemically classed as a glycoprotein, a sugar/protein aggregate, it leaks from the prostate into the blood, where its level can be measured with routine blood testing.\n\nAs men age, the prostate enlarges, increasing PSA levels. Screening tests take advantage of the fact that prostate cancer usually leaks more PSA than normal prostate tissue. And in the case of prostate cancer, the PSA typically rises relatively fast.\n\nBeyond these basic facts, the PSA story becomes hazy. Although an elevated PSA may signal cancer, most men with an elevated PSA have benign prostate enlargement, not prostate cancer. Worse yet for screening, many men with prostate cancer have a mild and slow-moving disease that requires no treatment. They coexist with their disease rather than dying of it. This fact leads to the old adage that prostate cancer is the disease of long-lived popes and Supreme Court justices.\n\nMedical advisory panels view PSA screening with skepticism partly due to the challenges of distinguishing benign PSA elevations from those related to cancer. Confirming a suspected cancer diagnosis requires prostate biopsies that can be painful and can produce side effects. Additionally, once a diagnosis is made, patients who might have coexisted with their disease may needlessly be subject to the harms of treatment, such as radiation and surgery. Finally, the benefits of early treatment of prostate cancer have been difficult to prove in clinical studies.\n\nFor all these reasons medical advisory panels have discouraged widespread testing or recommend a nuanced approach with careful discussion of risk and benefits between patients and their\n\nDespite these concerns, the pendulum has swung toward more PSA testing in recent years. One reason is that improvements in radiographic imaging, such as MRI, allow for “active surveillance” that can track early lesions for signs of spread, allowing doctors to distinguish between relatively benign cases of prostate cancer and those likely to progress. Interventions can then be directed more specifically to those at high risk.\n\nIn my medical practice, I have generally been an advocate for prostate cancer screening despite the controversy surrounding the clinical benefits. My experience leads me to believe that early diagnosis improves prognosis. But even without improved medical outcomes, patients and their families still benefit from early diagnosis for the purposes of planning. No one wants to be sideswiped by a late-stage symptomatic disease that limits both clinical and life choices.\n\nIn Biden’s case, after some initial delay a spokesperson revealed on May 20 that there had been no PSA testing since 2014, during Biden’s vice presidency. The reasons were not revealed.\n\nSuch a decision might have been justified based on questions about the benefits and risks of PSA testing. However, given the importance of the health of a vice president and potential future president one might have expected doctors to err on the side of more information. The omission invites speculation that the political implications of a borderline or increasing PSA might have played a decisive role. More information regarding his last PSA and the basis for the decision not to continue screening might put such speculation to rest.\n\nIn the past, the public has gained insight into important medical conditions from the unfortunate maladies affecting the first families. Colon cancer screening received increased attention after President Reagan’s diagnosis in 1985. Betty Ford’s public disclosure of her struggles with alcoholism and prescription drug dependency helped de-stigmatize treatment for substance use disorders.\n\nBiden’s illness also offers an opportunity. Consider that prostate cancer poses the greatest cancer mortality risk faced by non-smoking American men. Transparency in dealing with the former president’s condition would serve the public interest by increasing awareness and understanding of the important, nuanced care decisions faced by so many men.\n\nDaniel Stone is a practicing internist and geriatrician with Cedars Sinai Medical Group.

    "text": "By MICHAEL MILLENSON\n\nTreating artificial intelligence as just one ingredient in a business success recipe was a prominent theme at the MedCity INVEST 2025 conference, with this AI “best practice” advice epitomized by high-profile start-ups Inato and Prenosis.\n\n“You need to build a business model that makes sense, then use AI,” cautioned Raffi Boyajian, principal at CIGNA Ventures and a panelist at the MedCity INVEST 2025 conference in Chicago.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed and emphasized by fellow investors Aman Shah, vice president of new ventures at VNS Health, and Dipa Mehta, managing partner of Valeo Ventures. Both emphasized the necessity in a tough economic environment to find a “burning platform” that could immediately boost a customer’s bottom line.\n\nIn a separate panel, high-profile start-ups Inato and Prenosis accentuated that AI approach.\n\nInnovation Customers Need\n\nInato was named by Fast Company magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies of 2024, and that same year chosen by Fierce Healthcare as one of its Fierce 15. The Paris-based company connects drugmakers with otherwise hard-to-enroll patients for clinical trials by means of an AI-based platform that has attracted more than 3,000 community research sites in over 70 countries. By making clinical trials “more accessible, inclusive, and efficient,” in the company’s words, breaking a shocking pattern where 96% of trials do not include a representative population, Inato has established partnerships with more than a third of the top 30 pharmaceutical firms.\n\nIn describing its technology, Inato says it “assembled an AI agent to de-identify patient records, quickly determine which trials are relevant to each patient and evaluate patients against inclusion and exclusion criteria to assess eligibility” accurately and at scale. However, that phrase, “assembled an AI agent,” obscures a subtler process.\n\nLiz Beatty, Inato’s co-founder and chief strategy officer, described using “off-the-shelf” large language models like ChatGPT and Claude and then optimizing them for a particular process with algorithms attuned to each model. As new models appear, the company adjusts accordingly. Although Beatty did not offer an analogy, there seemed an obvious parallel to a chef choosing among the right ingredients in the right proportions to ensure a recipe’s success.\n\nSaid Beatty, “I hear, ‘Let’s apply AI to everything.’ That’s not the right answer.” Investors are convinced enough that Inato does have the right answer that they’ve poured in $38.2 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nAI has also been central to the success of Prenosis. The company’s Sepsis ImmunoScore was the first Food and Drug Administration-approved tool using AI to predict the imminent onset of an often-deadly condition known as sepsis. Integrated into the clinical workflow, it was hailed by Time magazine as one of “the best inventions of 2024,” while Bobby Reddy Jr., Prenosis co-founder and chief executive officer, was subsequently named to the Time100 Health List recognizing influential individuals in global health.\n\nChicago-based Prenosis describes itself as an artificial intelligence company tailoring therapy to individual patient biology as part of “a new era of precision medicine.” As with Inato, though, the AI headline hides a more complex reality.\n\nSepsis is a heterogenous syndrome with close to 200 different symptoms possibly at play. “AI brings it together so we can understand the process of deterioration,” Reddy said. The company used machine learning to develop and validate a sophisticated algorithm, according to a New England Journal of Medicine study.\n\nBut the right AI was only one product ingredient. Prenosis also assembled a database of thousands of patients and set up a “wet lab” to find sepsis biomarkers – and to use for other conditions as the company expands its offerings – based on what is now 120,000 blood samples. Adding biomarkers to EHR data enabled the company to position itself as a more accurate, real-time complement to the sepsis tool Epic provides free to hospitals using its EHR.\n\n“That’s our competitive advantage,” Reddy said.\n\nFocused AI\n\nJust as Inato focused on AI for its specific purposes, Prenosis also focused on a crucial goal. The AI was used “first and foremost to fit the FDA model for approval,” said Reddy.\n\nSepsis is caused by an overactive immune response to infection. It costs the U.S. health care system billions of dollars annually while claiming the lives of at least 350,000 people – more than all cancers combined, according to the Prenosis website. The World Health Organization has labeled sepsis a threat to global health, and the economic impact of just this one condition amounts to an average 2.7% of a nation’s health care costs, according to a 2022 study.\n\nUnmentioned by Reddy at the INVEST conference was that a U.S. hospital’s performance in preventing and effectively treating sepsis is a factor in value-based payment by Medicare and in the hospital patient safety score published by the Leapfrog Group. A “burning platform,” indeed.\n\nFor Prenosis and Inato alike, AI best practice is based on practicality. As Reddy put it, AI is “just a tool” in product development.\n\nMichael L.

    "text": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nAn appeals court is set to rehear a case from providers trying to restrict what factors insurers consider in calculating a key metric that arbiters use to determine fair payment amounts in disputes over out-of-network bills.\n\nIt’s a win for providers after a panel of judges from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals previously sided with the federal government in the case — and an unexpected one, given petitions for such rehearings are rarely granted.\n\nStill, a majority of 5th Circuit judges voted in favor of rehearing the Texas Medical Association’s case, vacating the panel’s decision from October, according to a court filing on Friday.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe lawsuit in question is one of a string of litigation from providers dead-set on changing how regulators implemented the No Surprises Act, a law passed in 2020 to hold consumers harmless for unexpected and often costly out-of-network medical bills.\n\nFollowing No Surprises, federal agencies set up a process called independent dispute resolution, wherein insurers and providers that can’t agree themselves on a fair payment for out-of-network services head to independent arbitration. Both parties present an arbiter with a reimbursement offer and the arbiter selects one of the two as the final payment amount.\n\nThat element of the process — how arbiters determine which offer is fair — is at the center of many legal cases from provider groups arguing regulators’ original interpretation of No Surprises weighs the determination in favor of insurers.\n\nSpecifically, the TMA, which has brought many of the suits, is concerned with how insurers calculate a metric called the qualifying payment amount, or QPA, and how much weight arbiters give the QPA in dispute resolution.\n\nThe QPA is meant to represent the median amount for contracted in-network services in a specific geographic area. However, providers say insurers are setting QPAs artificially low, which could lead arbiters to side with insurers.\n\nFor example, the suit in Friday’s ruling takes issue with insurers being allowed to use an amount other than the total maximum payment for a service in calculating the QPA when contracted rates include other payments, like bonus awards. It also sought to exclude “ghost rates,” or rates for items and services that providers don’t actually provide, from the calculation of the QPA.\n\nThe provisions “unfairly disadvantage physicians in federal arbitrations conducted to resolve out-of-network payment disputes with insurers under the No Surprises Act. TMA looks forward to another opportunity for the court to hear our arguments on these important issues,” TMA President Jay Shah said in a statement.\n\nThe TMA initially filed the lawsuit in November 2022 and a Texas district court ruled in the group’s favor. Federal agencies appealed and late last year a panel of 5th Circuit judges agreed with the HHS and other federal agencies, mostly overturning the lower court’s ruling.\n\nBut now, the 5th Circuit is set to rehear the case. The court has yet to set a briefing schedule.\n\nSince 2021, the TMA has filed four lawsuits over the No Surprises rules, arguing arbiters can’t presume the offer closest to the QPA is the appropriate rate, that arbiters can’t give outsized weight to the QPA and that fees to enter arbitration and other restrictions on providers lumping similar claims together into the same dispute are illegal and unfair.\n\nTo date, the TMA has largely prevailed in its suits, whether at the district level or on appeal.\n\nAlong with more disputes being lodged than regulators had anticipated, the TMA’s legal barrage has caused delays in No Surprises dispute resolution, contributing to a backlog in arbitration determinations, according to the CMS.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nSeniors on Medicare can now use PillPack from Amazon Pharmacy, a service that pre-sorts medication packets before sending them to consumers’ homes, the e-commerce giant announced Tuesday.\n\nAmazon also announced a new feature allowing customers to invite caregivers to manage medications on their behalf.\n\nThe new offerings appear geared at enticing the senior population — massive consumers of healthcare who may be unfamiliar with ordering medications online — to Amazon Pharmacy, which Amazon launched in 2020 and bills as a transparent marketplace for more affordable prescription drugs.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nDespite some downsizing last year and reports of lackluster consumer interest, Amazon has stayed bullish in the online pharmacy space, hoping to lean into what analysts say the company does best: profiting from streamlining clunky consumer experiences and making products more affordable.\n\nThe Seattle-based tech giant has hustled to build out Amazon Pharmacy: rolling out generic drug savings program RxPass and expanding it to Medicare, launching manufacturer coupons for select brand name medications and insulin and more.\n\nNow, Amazon says its new features announced Tuesday will help ensure people are filling their prescriptions and make it easier for caregivers to keep an eye on medications for their patients.\n\nPillPack, for example, sorts drugs into individual packets labeled by date and time. The service is meant for customers with two or more recurring prescriptions, who can sign up for PillPack at no additional cost.\n\nIts foray into Medicare means that the more than 50 million people in the federal insurance program’s prescription drug plans who take multiple medications can now use their insurance for PillPack, Amazon said. The expansion opens a big door for Amazon — Medicare is often the great white whale for companies hoping to gain access to a massive patient population that consumes an outsized amount of healthcare services.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for more detail on the offerings by time of publication.\n\nMost Medicare members have two or more chronic conditions — at least two-thirds of enrollees, according to government data. And, the program accounts for roughly one-fifth of the nation’s total health spending.\n\nAmazon is one of a rash of disruptors in the pharmacy space looking to entice clients fed up with rising drug prices and opaque pharmaceutical supply chains. The companies, many of which are growing quickly, have been making life difficult for legacy drugstore chains like CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid (the latter of which is currently undergoing its second bankruptcy, citing — among other factors — increasing competition).\n\nAlong with pharmacy, Amazon is also focusing on care delivery. Despite some high-profile crash-and-burns of past offerings, including hybrid care provider Amazon Care and cost-lowering venture Haven, Amazon has built out online marketplaces for telehealth and chronic condition management, and acquired medical chain One Medical in 2022.",

Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nDive Brief:\n\nFired HHS employees are suing the Trump administration for illegally terminating thousands of employees in the federal health department’s spring restructuring based on incorrect records.\n\nSeven affected staffers filed the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, Tuesday in a D.C. district court against the HHS, the Department of Government Efficiency and other agencies and top leaders in the Trump administration.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks monetary damages for HHS employees who were let go with termination notices that contained errors. Lawyers estimate that most of the roughly 10,000 employees who were fired during the April reduction-in-force, or RIF, would be members of the class.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThe HHS began notifying employees that they would be laid off on April 1 as part of a departmental restructuring, amid the Trump administration’s larger push to drastically reduce the federal workforce.\n\nThe process was quickly dogged with questions about its legitimacy, with many affected staffers noting that termination notices included incorrect performance scores, office names and other information.\n\nHealthcare Dive has reported extensively on the potential illegality of the RIF, including paperwork issues, the closure of congressionally mandated offices and inconsistencies with how the Trump administration decided which employees to terminate.\n\nNow, a group of terminated HHS staffers are suing over the “hopelessly error-ridden” personnel records that were used to underpin the cuts.\n\nPerformance ratings, which range from 1 to 5 and are assigned to federal staff to appraise their performance, were frequently wrong on RIF notices, the workers allege in their suit. In addition, employees’ paperwork had seemingly random codes determining their eligibility for the RIF, and informed them that their entire division was being terminated when it wasn’t.\n\nSuch errors are a major point of concern, given that data affects whether a specific employee should have been caught up in a RIF, their severance pay and the availability of stopgap healthcare coverage — and can affect future career prospects.\n\nHHS’ actions violated the Privacy Act, which gives individuals recourse if an agency acts on the basis of inaccurate personnel records, according to the suit.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. However, the agency in the past has blamed siloed and disorganized recordkeeping for discrepancies in RIF paperwork.\n\n“It is, of course, little solace to these Plaintiffs that they were fired because of ‘siloed’ recordkeeping. Nor is it any comfort to know that many of them had been fired by ‘mistake,’” the lawsuit reads. “For these Plaintiffs, HHS’s intentional failure to maintain complete and accurate records before making life-changing employment decisions was a clear violation of the law.”\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has publicly acknowledged that mistakes were made during the restructuring due to the agency’s desire to move quickly, and pledged to reinstate staff who were improperly let go. The HHS has since rescinded RIF notices for hundreds of employees. However, the secretary has brushed off ongoing concerns about the cuts and failed to provide a comprehensive accounting of the layoffs.\n\n“Because the decisionmakers at these agencies were working with such flawed data, they barely knew who they were cutting,” Clayton Bailey, a lawyer at the Civil Service Law Center, which is bringing the suit, said in a statement. “These employees suffered the consequences.”\n\nThe RIF was supposed to go into effect early June. However, the firings were paused after a California federal judge issued an injunction in a separate lawsuit over the administration slashing the federal workforce without Congress’ say-so.\n\nA group of states are also suing the Trump administration seeking to undo the HHS cuts, arguing the department’s critical health work has been stymied as a result of the restructuring.\n\nMany affected workers remain on administrative leave.",

    "text": "Listen to the article 4 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback\n\nThe Trump administration rescinded guidance on Tuesday directing hospitals to perform abortions during medical emergencies, even in states with restrictive abortion bans.\n\nThe Biden administration published the guidance in 2022, shortly after Roe v. Wade was overturned, asserting doctors were required to perform emergency care, even if that included abortions, under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.\n\nThe decades-old law states Medicare-funded hospitals must provide medical services when required to stabilize a patient’s life or health. The Biden administration argued patients experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, complications of pregnancy loss or emergent hypertensive disorders were entitled to stabilizing medical care under the federal law — including abortion services.\n\nThe CMS now says that guidance “does not reflect the policy of this Administration.” The new guidance is effective May 29, and furthers an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to remove regulatory red tape, the CMS said.\n\nThere have been multiple signals the Trump administration might reverse course on EMTALA protections. During HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation hearings, he waffled on whether emergency abortions were federally legal in states with bans. Kennedy first said he didn’t know whether EMTALA would cover emergency abortions, before clarifying the next day that it did — but only in life-saving circumstances.\n\nThen in March, the Justice Department dropped its Biden-era lawsuit seeking to require Idaho providers to offer emergency abortion care.\n\nThe CMS says it will continue to enforce EMTALA, including in cases where the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child are in “serious jeopardy.” However, the agency did not offer specifics about what constitutes serious jeopardy.\n\nTexas and Idaho, which have some of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans, have repeatedly argued that there is no conflict between EMTALA and their policies, because both states allow abortion when the mother’s life is at risk.\n\n“It has been our position from the beginning that there is no conflict between EMTALA and Idaho’s Defense of Life Act,” said Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador in a statement in March, after the DOJ dropped its case against the state. “The goal of each is to save lives in every circumstance, both the mother and their unborn child.”\n\nHowever, providers and women’s health organizations say that in practice life-saving abortions do not occur in states with restrictive bans without EMTALA protections, in part due to confusion about when a provider is allowed to act.\n\nNancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, previously told Healthcare Dive that providers had resorted to airlifting hemorrhaging women out of states with abortion bans in order to receive emergency services when EMTALA protections were not in place.\n\nA spokesperson for the CMS did not comment on whether the administration believed EMTALA would cover any emergency abortion services. However, the agency said it planned to “rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration’s actions.”",

    "text": "John Wilkerson is a Washington correspondent for STAT who writes about the politics of health care. He is also the author of the twice-weekly D.C. Diagnosis newsletter .\n\nWASHINGTON — House Republicans’ tax bill would lead to nearly 11 million people losing health insurance, providing a key source of savings to help finance President Trump’s tax cuts, according to projections that nonpartisan congressional scorekeepers published Wednesday.\n\nAnother 5.1 million people would become uninsured from a combination of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and new ACA rules that Trump’s health department proposed, the Congressional Budget Office said. Those coverage losses are separate from the CBO’s official score of the tax bill.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAltogether, 16 million people could become uninsured over a decade, the same number who were at risk of losing their insurance when Republicans attempted to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, CBO said.\n\nThe CBO projections give Democrats ammunition to attack Republicans for taking insurance from low-income voters to pay for tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich. Most Republicans say the bill only takes insurance from those without jobs who are able to work and that pregnant women, children, people with disabilities, and frail older adults will not be affected.\n\nHouse Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), for example, said the CBO score shows the “catastrophic consequences” of the bill.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOverall, the bill increases the federal deficit by $2.4 trillion over a decade, thanks to its extension of Trump’s tax cuts and the enactment of new ones. Extending lower tax rates alone costs $2.2 trillion over a decade, for example. The bill includes cuts to federal spending on health coverage of more than $1 trillion.\n\nAbout 7.8 million people would lose Medicaid coverage, while much of the rest of the losses would stem from the Affordable Care Act’s exchanges. Among those losing coverage would be 1.4 million immigrants and others who don’t have, or can’t prove, a legal status that would give them access to insurance.\n\nThe bill imposes new restrictions on health insurance targeted at states that use their own funds to cover undocumented immigrants. It also makes ineligible some groups of immigrants who previously qualified for coverage, such as refugees and people granted asylum.\n\nTaken together, the estimates show that the bill could represent the largest cuts to federal health care programs in history. Hospitals, which are in an especially vulnerable position, will use the CBO projections to fight for changes in the Senate that curb enrollment losses.\n\nSenators will no doubt make changes to the House bill, and some are worried about Medicaid cuts, though the bill’s imposition of work requirements remains popular even among those with concerns. They are not expected to write a new bill from scratch, due to time constraints. Republicans aim to pass the bill before July 4, but the real deadline might be when the government reaches its borrowing limit, expected sometime around August.\n\nThe health care portions of the bill can be placed in two big buckets: Medicaid cuts and reforms to the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\n\nThe addition of work requirements to the Medicaid program is responsible for about $344 billion of the savings in the bill, the most of any health care provision. CBO estimates that 18.5 million people would face the requirements, and that 5.2 million adults would lose Medicaid coverage as a result.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe bill would require people up to age 64 who are without dependents or disabilities to work at least 80 hours a month in order to keep coverage. They would need to document twice a year that they’re working. They could also maintain coverage if they perform community service or are enrolled in educational programs.\n\nRelated Story How Trump’s tax cut bill would reshape health care\n\nThat savings figure is up from earlier estimates because Republicans decided to start the work requirements earlier, by Dec. 31, 2026. When the CBO had last scored that provision, the measure took effect in 2029, after the next presidential election. Even still, Medicaid enrollees probably would not have to deal with work requirements until after the midterms.\n\nThe bill doesn’t renew enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Lawmakers could still choose to extend them in another bill. If the subsidies expire, the cost of ACA plans would go up and about 4.2 million people would become uninsured.\n\nThe CBO had done preliminary “scores” of the bill, which projected the budget impact of measures and their effect on enrollment. But the CBO didn’t have time to analyze measures that were added last minute, and they hadn’t yet accounted for how pieces of the bill interact.\n\nTwo measures aimed at curbing states’ ability to increase federal funding of their Medicaid programs would together save $162 billion. The measures include new limits on states’ provider taxes and on state-directed payment programs.\n\nThe bill would also save $145.7 billion through limits on Medicaid enrollment flexibilities, including delaying a rule to streamline enrollment and requiring the eligibility of expansion enrollees to be re-evaluated more frequently.\n\nIn a smaller bucket, the bill includes reforms to drug middlemen, which amount to $640 million in government savings. It would limit how pharmacy benefit managers can receive money from drugmakers, impose transparency requirements, and prevent spread pricing in Medicaid.\n\nThe bill also would boost payments to doctors by $8.9 billion over a decade by partially basing their Medicare payment rates on medical inflation. A measure to expand the exemption from Medicare price negotiation to orphan drugs with multiple indications would increase spending by $4.9 billion. There’s also a provision pausing a Biden-era rule, unpopular among Republicans, to require higher staffing levels at nursing homes. CBO estimates the pause would save $23 billion over 10 years.\n\n\n\nadvertisement\n\nChelsea Cirruzzo contributed reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with CBO estimates related to the expiration of ACA subsidies. An earlier version of this article misstated the savings attributed to changes to pharmacy benefit managers.",

After 307 days at CHOP, KJ was dressed in what early studies suggest are the world’s smallest and cutest graduation cap-and-gown before leaving.\n\nIt’s a promising sign for KJ, his family, and the therapy researchers built in just 6 months. Born with an ultra-rare disease that prevented his liver from breaking down ammonia, he was rushed to CHOP, where specialists kept him under strict monitoring to prevent ammonia from flaring and doing long-term damage. Typically, he would receive a liver transplant. Instead, scientists across the country teamed to devise a gene-editing treatment.\n\nKJ received the first of three doses at six months old. He’s now 10 months old. The hope is that, while not cured, he has been left with a far more mild version of his disease. Meanwhile, researchers are working on ways to scale his treatment for thousands of others.\n\nadvertisement\n\nctDNA testing surges, but impact remains unproven\n\nCirculating tumor DNA blood tests are rapidly gaining popularity among oncologists for their potential to detect cancer recurrence and treatment resistance earlier than traditional imaging. But despite their promise, data presented at the annual ASCO meeting this week suggest that the clinical value of ctDNA tests is still unproven.\n\nWhile some trials hint at benefits, others lack conclusive survival outcomes — which raises concern about whether early interventions based on ctDNA actually improve patients’ lives.\n\n“We need evidence to know the true value of these tests,” University of Pennsylvania cancer researcher Angela DeMichelle told STAT’s Angus Chen. “They have incredible potential to help people, but if we don’t do the studies and don’t do them the right way, we can hurt people.”\n\nRead more.\n\nVinay Prasad talks RCTs, endpoints at NORD\n\nVinay Prasad, the new chief of CBER at the FDA, spoke at a meeting of the National Organization for Rare Disorders yesterday. Though for years the firebrand oncologist emphasized the importance of rigorous randomized controlled trials, he now asserts that not every drug for every disease needs one — especially ultra-rare diseases. He cited the case of Baby KJ, saying “the U.S. FDA is firmly committed to making sure all of these therapies come through as quickly as posisble, and that people that people have access to these therapies as soon as possible.”\n\nHe also appeared to strike a different tune on another issue for which he has demonstrated zeal: “Some people may think I’m a critic of surrogate endpoints and I only want overall survival. But I want to say the answer is both,” he said, adding that the FDA “will take action at the first sign of promise for rare diseases.”\n\nThe agency’s approach, he said, is to “take action at the earliest statistically persuasive biomarker changes that are reasonably likely to predict clinical outcomes.”\n\nOpinion: Change to Covid vaccine recommendations could jeopardize pregnant health\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s move to drop Covid vaccine recommendation for pregnant people represents a major ethical and public health setback, opines Johns Hopkins bioethicist Ruth Faden.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a new First Opinion, she warns that reversing course on vaccination guidance ignores clear evidence of the vaccine’s benefits for both mothers and their newborns — protection that’s especially crucial in the face of heightened risks like preterm birth and stillbirth.\n\nFaden, who helped lead national efforts to close the longstanding medical research gap around pregnancy in pandemics, says Kennedy’s push to require randomized controlled trials is both scientifically unnecessary and ethically indefensible.\n\nRead more.\n\nMore reads",

If you’re based in New York, consider spending tomorrow evening at a free happy hour, on STAT.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe CDC chronic disease unit will fold, despite MAHA’s focus\n\nThe HHS budget for 2026, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic. This makes sense, given the agency leadership’s focus on eradicating chronic disease. But the budget also proposes abolishing the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, instead folding it into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity that will also bring other centers under its umbrella.\n\nBut shifting work on chronic diseases to AHA may create more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT’s Liz Cooney. “That other agency does not exist right now,” she said. “We don’t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.” Read more from Liz on what the budget says about the future of chronic disease prevention work.\n\nCMS rescinds Biden’s EMTALA guidance on pregnant patients\n\nFederal health officials have rescinded guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 that aimed to ensure hospitals in states with strict abortion bans would still provide appropriate emergency care like abortion to pregnant people if necessary.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Biden administration’s guidance was issued weeks after the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs case and, in a separate decision, dismissed a case focused on whether or not EMTALA — the federal legislation that establishes the right to emergency medical care regardless of one’s ability to pay — includes emergency abortion care. Then-Secretary Xavier Becerra emphasized in a letter on the guidance that a clinician’s legal and professional duty to provide such treatment should preempt any local restrictions.\n\nCMS said that it will continue to enforce EMTALA, and will work to “rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability” the guidance had created. But experts have long said that the source of confusion lies with state bans on abortions, which often offer vague criteria for which life-threatening emergencies may lead to an exemption. Read more from the AP.\n\nResearchers use continuous glucose monitors to link individual responses to metabolic states\n\nWith the number of people living with diabetes set to double in the coming decades, researchers are intensely interested in understanding why blood sugar levels can vary markedly after a meal between people eating the same food. A study published in Nature Medicine today offers new evidence that this person-to-person variation has to do with metabolic features that could inform personalized diabetes prevention and treatment plans.\n\nA team led by Stanford researchers recruited 55 adults, nearly half of whom had prediabetes while most others had normal sugar levels, and had them wear continuous glucose monitors as they ate same-sized portions of meals delivered to their homes, with the foods including rice, bread, shredded potatoes, pasta, beans, grapes, and a mix of berries. The authors found that high glucose spikes after pasta were often linked to insulin resistance, a person’s body not responding to the hormone, whereas participants with especially strong responses to potatoes included people who had beta cell dysfunction, meaning insulin-producing cells either struggled to produce the hormone or to release it. Subjects with spikes after eating bread were more likely to have high blood pressure. The authors also found that an oft-recommended strategy of eating fat, protein, or fiber before a carb-rich food did blunt glucose levels, but only in people who were responsive to insulin. — Jonathan Wosen\n\nadvertisement\n\nEveryone’s using these tests for cancer — but the data aren’t there\n\nTests searching for tumor DNA in the blood are surging in popularity, mainly because they can clue clinicians into what’s happening with a patient’s cancer long before any changes appear on more traditional tools like MRI or CT scans. The tests can show if cancer patients will recur months before any lesions are visible, and some tests’ results can give information about how a cancer will or is responding to a certain therapy.\n\nIt sounds good, right? These tests are commercially available and covered by Medicare. But there’s one problem: Experts don’t know if these tests actually help patients. STAT’s Angus Chen spoke to cancer researchers about the technology, and all of them were enthusiastic about the technology’s promise, but not ready to say these tests are useful in guiding better clinical decisions.\n\n“Research is trying to keep up with the pace of clinical use. It’s a really exciting technology, but it’s difficult to interpret and actually use test results,” oncologist Stacey Cohen told Angus. Read more about how the hype might not match the research.\n\nHow incarceration affects mortality — for people both inside and out\n\nIt’s long been understood that incarceration has long-term effects on health and mortality. But a study controlling for both individual and area-level factors has new numbers on the connection. People who were incarcerated in 2008 had a 39% higher risk of dying and more than three times the risk of dying from an overdose by 2019 than people who weren’t, according to the study, published yesterday in JAMA Network Open. And the risk of incarceration doesn’t just affect the people inside — researchers also found that county incarceration rates were associated with increased all-cause mortality risks for nonincarcerated residents. (That increased risk for nonincarcerated people was not there when it came to overdose mortality.)\n\nThe results come from an analysis of more than 3.2 million people whose information from a 2008 Census interview was connected to mortality data through 2019. Most other studies are limited in that their control group is based on the general population, rather than people in the same area from the same dataset, the authors write. The results show how urgently improved health care during and after incarceration is needed, they add, specifically pointing to community-based primary care as a potential solution.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn related news on incarceration and health, a federal judge has ruled that the federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care including hormones and social accommodations to trans incarcerated people, blocking an executive order prohibiting such care. The AP has more.\n\nAmerica can’t afford to lose international physicians\n\nWhen the Trump administration put a pause on student visa interviews last week, thousands of J-1 physician visa holders poised to start their residency programs this summer were thrown into limbo. In a new First Opinion essay, orthopedic surgeon and former HHS secretary Tom Price argues that the country cannot afford to lose these doctors.\n\nThe government’s own projections show that the U.S. will be short 124,000 physicians by 2027. The country has long benefited from attracting smart, medically-minded people from all over the world. Now, Congress needs to step up and create more flexible visa programs for international medical students to stay in America for work.

    "text": "The amount of funding going into biotechnology companies has fallen off over the last couple months, a trend the investment bank Jefferies pins on Trump administration policies aimed at gutting the agencies responsible for conducting and regulating drug research.\n\nLooking at financial data from FactSet, Jefferies analysts found biotech funding in May was down 57%, to just over $2.7 billion, compared to the same time last year. That sum was only slightly better than the nearly $2.6 billion raised in April — the worst haul in three years — and was also 44% lower than the average seen across the past 12 months.\n\nThe analysts, David Windley and Tucker Remmers, argue that these declines have been exacerbated by Trump’s White House. They believe unclear plans to lower U.S. drug prices, coupled with mass layoffs at the Food and Drug Administration and colossal budget cuts proposed for the National Institutes of Health, have diminished investor confidence in biotech.\n\n“Current policy proposals and agency staffing cuts have cast a cloud over biotech investment,” Windley and Remmers wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “Since product development cycles can range 12-15 years in this industry, biotechs (and their boards and investors) want clarity on FDA regulation, drug pricing, and funding before committing to large, [long-term] investments.”\n\nAs such, the “current environment is not conducive to biotech investment right now, contributing to the soft funding,” they added.\n\nSignificant dips in funding can hurt any industry. But they’re especially dangerous for biotech, where the expensive process of discovering and testing new medicines requires companies to raise cash on a near-constant basis. Most drug startups never become profitable.\n\nThe recent pullback, then, means it’s likely some companies are operating even further in the red. Jefferies’ analysis found funding for public biotechs — whether from an initial public offering, a follow-on stock offering or a so-called PIPE deal — totaled $1.1 billion in May, “far below” the roughly $4.5 billion of cash those companies burn through each month on average.\n\nInvestors have also increasingly been pressuring the boards of struggling biotech companies to liquidate and return capital to shareholders rather than continue on in a difficult climate. In the past couple of months alone, cancer drugmaker iTeos and immune system specialist Third Harmonic Bio each announced plans to sell their assets and shut down.\n\nMany others are evaluating options. California-based Tempest Therapeutics, for example, is exploring strategic transactions because it doesn’t have enough money to complete studies of its main drug. Tempest CEO Stephen Brady said capital markets “have been unavailable to support the next stage of advancement.”\n\nAccording to the Jefferies analysts, venture capital contributions have “held up better” than the public markets’ so far this year, with the former down 12% compared to 2024 and the latter down 62%. Monthly venture capital funding has averaged about $1.9 billion in 2025, they wrote.\n\nThe analysts also noted how, last year, the first quarter had the highest levels of biotech funding. The comparative declines should therefore begin to ease in the back half of this year.\n\nWhat may not ease is the “uncertainty on steroids” that biotech investors and dealmakers say they’ve been contending with for the last six months. Some investment firms claim they’ve already seen changes in their day to day. At Lux Capital, principal David Yang previously told BioPharma Dive that some academic institutions were asking for money to cover overhead costs shortly after hearing news of the proposed NIH cuts.\n\nAnd at the Chicago Biomedical Consortium, Executive Director Michelle Hoffmann said her team is “incredibly worried” they won’t “get enough projects through our process to be building new, small companies.”\n\nThere is “a lot of fear and uncertainty” and “tightening belts,” she said.",

    "text": "Dive Brief:\n\nLooking to defend its giant cardiometabolic health franchise, Eli Lilly is licensing a technology from Swedish biotechnology firm Camurus that promises to produce longer-acting medications.\n\nCamurus’ FluidCrystal technology is designed to methodically release a therapeutic drug substance into the body over a period of days or months. After an injection, the solution interacts with bodily fluids to transform into a liquid crystalline gel. The gel holds the active ingredient and then slowly degrades, releasing medicine.\n\nThe deal includes an unspecified upfront payment as part of an initial package that may be worth as much as $290 million, Camurus said Tuesday. That figure also includes payments for reaching certain development and regulatory milestones. Another $580 million could be available for meeting sales goals, along with mid-single digit royalties for successful products.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nLilly and rival Novo Nordisk revolutionized diabetes and obesity treatment over the last few years with GLP-1 medicines that opened up one of the biggest markets the pharmaceutical industry has ever seen. In the first quarter alone, Lilly raked in more than $6 billion from sales of tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity. Novo brought in even more from its Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nNow Lilly and Novo are faced with defending the market as a raft of competitors vie to offer newer and better options. Both companies have bulked up their pipelines; Lilly recently claimed success in a Phase 3 trial of a GLP-1 medicine that can be taken in pill form instead of injection. It also has a triple-acting drug in development and a number of other experimental medicines that work differently.\n\nThe Camurus deal allows Lilly to apply the long-acting technology to as many as four of its drug compounds. That may help the company stave off competitors such as Metsera, which in January announced promising research for its experimental long-acting GLP-1 shot.\n\nMeanwhile, Roche recently announced a $1.65 billion deal to expand its obesity pipeline and Amgen and Viking Therapeutics are both moving into late-stage studies of potential rival treatments. Companies are also working on ways to augment the Lilly and Novo medicines. Veru is testing a drug designed to help preserve muscle when taken with Novo’s Wegovy. Regeneron and others are conducting similar research.",

    "text": "Today, a brief rundown of news involving Regeneron and Bluebird bio, as well as updates from Atai Life Sciences, Alto Neuroscience and UniQure that you may have missed.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday disclosed Phase 2 study results that it claimed suggest the addition of one or two of its experimental medicines to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy might help people with obesity preserve muscle mass. Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger, however, described the results in a research note as \"mixed,\" highlighting how the addition of Regeneron's drug resulted in either numerically lower weight loss with \"comparable tolerability\" or \"greater weight loss with worse tolerability.\" The effects on muscle function, which haven't yet been disclosed, will be \"critical,” Risinger added. Draft guidance published by the Food and Drug Administration has indicated muscle-protecting medicines \"need to demonstrate functional benefits\" to succeed. — Ben Fidler\n\nRegeneron also expanded its portfolio of weight-loss medicines, announcing on Monday a deal for most worldwide rights to a drug developed by Hansoh Pharmaceuticals Group that's currently in late-stage testing in obesity in China. Regeneron paid Hansoh $80 million upfront for the drug, which, like Eli Lilly's Zepbound targets the gut hormones GLP-1 and GIP. It could add nearly $2 billion in additional payouts. In testing, the drug has demonstrated a \"potentially similar profile\" to Zepbound, Regeneron said. — Ben Fidler\n\nCarlyle Group and SK Capital on Monday closed a deal to acquire and take private gene therapy developer Bluebird bio. The two private equity firms said they’ve provided “significant primary capital” to support and scale Bluebird’s gene therapies for rare blood and brain diseases, and that the company will now prioritize building up its manufacturing capabilities and strengthening relationships with insurers. Bluebird’s stock, which will no longer trade on the Nasdaq, last closed at around $5 per share. — Ben Fidler\n\nPsychedelics developer Atai Life Sciences is absorbing the rest of a U.K.-based biotechnology company through an all-share transaction announced Monday. Atai last year took a nearly 36% stake in Beckley Psytech, providing it access to an experimental version of the mind-altering compound mebufotenin. Now, the two developers are combining in a deal that values Beckley at $390 million and is expected to close in the back half of this year. Beckley’s investors other than Atai will be issued around 105 million new shares as consideration, representing about 31% of the combined company.

    "text": "An experimental, non-hormonal drug from Bayer can reduce the hot flashes and other menopausal side effects many women taking a common breast cancer therapy experience, according to results from a late-stage clinical trial run by the pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe study, known as Oasis-4, is the fourth successful trial test of Bayer’s drug, called elinzanetant. Detailed data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting Monday showed treatment reduced vasomotor symptoms in women receiving endocrine therapy to treat or prevent hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\nVasomotor symptoms include hot flashes and disrupted sleep, and are typically associated with menopause. However, these symptoms can occur in almost 90% of women with early breast cancer who are treated with endocrine drugs. The side effects are disruptive enough to sometimes cause breast cancer patients to stop treatment, which could affect disease progression and, ultimately, survival.\n\nIn women experiencing menopause, hormone-replacement therapies can be used to treat vasomotor symptoms. But in women with early-stage breast cancer, those same treatments can increase the risk of their disease worsening or returning.\n\n“With no currently approved treatments for this indication, there is an unmet medical need for therapeutic options,” said Fatima Cardoso, the study’s lead investigator and the director of the breast cancer unit at the Champalimaud Cancer Center in Lisbon, Portugal, in a statement provided by Bayer.\n\nElinzanent provides a non-hormonal option. The drug targets two receptors, NK1 and NK3, that help regulate body temperature. In Oasis-4, 316 participants were randomly assigned to take elinzanetant once daily, while 157 received placebo. Vasomotor symptoms were assessed at one and three months. After 12 weeks, people who had been given placebo were switched to elinzanetant for the remainder of the main one-year evaluation period.\n\nResults showed that elinzanetant quickly alleviated symptoms at both weeks 4 and 12 compared to placebo, meeting the study’s primary goal. After one month, 61% of women taking the Bayer drug reported the frequency of daily moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms had been reduced by at least half. And at three months, women taking the drug experienced greater improvements in sleep and quality of life compared to those on placebo.\n\nTrial participants who switched to elinzanetant after taking a placebo for 12 weeks also experienced similar benefits.\n\n“It's due time that new innovation comes into this space,” said Yesmean Wahdan, vice president of U.S. medical affairs for Bayer’s women’s health unit, in an interview with BioPharma Dive. “[This therapy] really aims at targeting the source of what's causing the symptoms that are happening as the woman goes through the menopausal transition and into menopause.”\n\nThe Oasis-4 results were also published in The New England Journal of Medicine Monday.\n\nLast year, Bayer unveiled data from a Phase 3 study of women taking elinzanetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The drug proved efficacious among this group of women as well, supporting an application by Bayer for approval.\n\n“[Menopause] is a condition many women will enter into and face no matter where you are in life,” Wahdan said. “Some enter it via clinical reasons. They're put on medications, they have surgery. And some of us enter it as a transition in life.”\n\nIf approved in women with vasomotor symptoms as a result of their breast cancer treatment, elinzanetant would be the first therapeutic of its kind.\n\n“It's a therapy that is targeted at all women who are experiencing these [vasomotor] symptoms,” Wahdan said. “We know that [women taking endocrine therapy] have, for a long time, been excluded from some of the more traditional therapies for symptoms of menopause.”\n\nOne approved non-hormonal option for vasomotor symptoms comes from Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma, but it is not approved for women being treated for breast cancer. Called Veozah, the drug has struggled commercially due to weaker-than-expected demand and reimbursement issues. The Food and Drug Administration also recently added a safety warning for possible liver damage to the drug’s labeling.\n\nIn Oasis-4, almost 70% of women taking elinzanetant reported at least one adverse event, versus 62% of those in the placebo group. There were serious adverse events reported in eight women treated with Bayer’s drug. Most commonly, however, side effects were fatigue, headache and drowsiness.\n\nIn an editorial published in NEJM, Ann Partridge, interim chair of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s medical oncology department, noted that a better understanding of elinzanetant’s side effects will be essential to incorporating the drug in patient care.\n\n“Reassuringly, the present trial and previous trials of elinzanetant have shown no increased risk of toxic effects on the liver, which have been reported in rare cases with another agent in this class,” she wrote, referring to Veozah.",

    "text": "CHICAGO — A Johnson & Johnson drug currently used for advanced prostate cancer can help keep the disease from progressing in men who are at earlier stages and have certain genetic mutations, according to newly unveiled data from a Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nResults from this trial, named Amplitude, were released Tuesday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s meeting in Chicago. They could potentially expand the number of people able to receive J&J’s Akeega, a pill that combines the active ingredients from the medicines Zejula and Zytiga.\n\nAkeega, along with hormone therapy, kept men with so-called BRCA mutations from getting sicker for longer than Zytiga and hormone therapy, reducing the relative risk of disease progression by nearly half. The combination also reduced by 56% the risk that BRCA-positive participants in the study experienced symptoms of disease progression.\n\nAkeega is already approved for men whose disease stops responding to hormone therapy if they have BRCA mutations, which often signal a more aggressive cancer. This stage of disease, classified as “castration resistant,” is considered to be advanced.\n\nAkeega’s constituent drug components target the proteins PARP and CYP17, respectively. Drugs aimed at CYP17 have been used in prostate cancer for more than a decade, while PARP inhibitors are more recent arrivals. However, in prostate cancer, PARP blockers are largely used in the castration-resistant setting, where testosterone suppression no longer keeps the disease in check.\n\nSome physicians and drugmakers have explored moving treatment to early-stage disease as a way of helping patients live longer. Amplitude was set up to test that hypothesis.\n\n“The challenge is that when we use PARP inhibitors as monotherapy at the end of the treatment sequence, resistance rapidly develops, and the median time to radiographic progression-free survival is shorter than 12 months,” said Gerhardt Attard, a professor of medical oncology at University College London and lead author of the study, in a press conference presenting the data. “This group of patients have poor outcomes, significantly worse outcomes than other patients.”\n\nBradley McGregor, a genitourinary specialist with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said the study results will help clear up debate over where PARP inhibitors fit into treatment of people with hormone-sensitive disease. “This data is quite compelling for the BRCA 1/2 patients where that magnitude of benefit is higher,” he said.\n\nAmplitude enrolled men with a broader set of mutations to homologous recombination repair, or HRR, genes, of which BRCA is one. The benefit in the overall population was smaller, with Akeega reducing the risk of radiographic progression by 37% and symptomatic progression by half.\n\nAkeega is currently approved only for the narrow BRCA-mutated population. Of the PARP inhibitors on the market, only AstraZeneca’s Lynparza has won clearance for the broader HRR population, but its use is reserved for castration-resistant disease.\n\nMark Wildgust, J&J’s global medical affairs vice president for oncology, said the HRR results from Amplitude should stimulate some discussion with the Food and Drug Administration. The company must keep working with regulators “to see if there is room or comfort to expand to that broader population,” he said.\n\nTrial investigators also analyzed results by specific HRR mutations beyond BRCA. With some, like one called PALB2, patients didn’t see any benefit, Wildgust said. “I think with smaller patient groups, it's a bit more difficult,” he added.\n\nPhysicians will need to be able to identify the patients most likely to benefit, should Akeega gain an expanded approval in earlier-stage prostate cancer. “You don’t know if you don’t test,” McGregor said.\n\nAkeega first won approval in 2023. Johson & Johnson didn’t report annual sales for the drug in 2024.\n\nGSK has some rights to Zejula, Akeega’s PARP-inhibiting ingredient, by way of its 2019 acquisition of the drug's developer, Tesaro Bio. J&J had previously licensed rights to niraparib in prostate cancer specifically, allowing it to market Akeega.",

    "text": "AI scribes are having a significant positive impact on clinicians. With ambient listening and automated note generation, some clinicians are rediscovering joy in their work, thanks to well-integrated AI tools. Clinicians at MedPeds are experiencing more joy thanks to Sunoh.ai\n\nAI Tools Helping Clinicians\n\nFor years, ambient documentation and AI scribes were pie-in-the-sky concepts. They always seemed “just around the corner”, but thanks to rapid improvements in AI technology and a willingness to adopt it by clinicians, it is quickly becoming a must-have tool for clinicians.\n\nMedPeds, has served adult and pediatric patients since 1999. They have been using electronic medical records since 2004 (pre- Meaningful Use) and have been on the eClinicalWorks EHR platform. They have always been on the cutting edge of healthcare IT and it was no surprise that they were one of the first to implement Sunoh.ai as an AI scribe.\n\nHealthcare IT Today sat down with Seth Eaton, MD, Medical Director at MedPeds to learn more about the impact of Sunoh.ai and to find out about the benefits of the PRISMA interoperability solution they recently implemented.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nAI must integrate directly into the clinical workflow. MedPeds saw restored joy in practice and better documentation by letting ambient AI handle note taking in real time—no extra steps, no after-hours charting. Passive data capture improves patient safety. AI-generated summaries captured key patient details that can be missed while clinicians are multitasking (ie: listening to patient while looking up something in their chart or for the latest clinical best practice). Background listening can fill clinical gaps without workflow disruption. Interoperability benefits finally being felt by clinicians. The PRISMA solution surfaced critical information to the family physician (like a lung nodule missed by a specialist) even when no note was formally sent by the specialist, enabling more informed, proactive decisions during routine visits.\n\nAI Scribes are Changing the Mood of Medicine\n\nClinicians dislike and are frustrated by the hours of documentation they are forced to do into their EHR systems – particularly if they must do it after hours. By automating note taking, AI scribes like Sunoh.ai are freeing clinicians from the keyboard.\n\n“We are enjoying the visits more,” shared Dr. Eaton. “It’s just more fun to talk to the patients and not have to focus entirely on the computer.”\n\nIt is a pleasant surprise that a relatively new technology is living up to its promised hype. However, improved clinician mood is not the only benefit MedPeds has realized.\n\nBackground Listening Is a Safety Net\n\nMultitasking during visits is a reality, and even the most experienced clinicians miss things. That’s where AI summaries offer unexpected value.\n\n“There’s been more than one occasion that I looked back at the AI summary and there was something of importance the patient said that I did not hear clearly at the time,” admitted Dr. Eaton.\n\nIt is unrealistic to expect physicians to have perfect recall of a patient encounter, especially in a busy clinic. The ambient listening provided by the AI scribe adds a second layer of safety. It does not replace clinician judgment, instead AI scribes improve it by providing additional information that may have otherwise been overlooked or forgotten.\n\nInteroperability That Finally Benefits Clinicians\n\nJust like AI in healthcare, interoperability has been long sought, yet has remained mostly wishful thinking for decades. However, recently, smaller-scale interoperability efforts have been gaining momentum. Healthcare IT systems are starting to talk and share data with local providers.\n\nMedPeds has begun to use PRISMA, an interoperability solution, to query for and pull in additional health information about its patients. This information come from a variety of sources including health information exchanges (HIEs), labs, imaging centers, and many others.\n\nDr. Eaton shared an example where the use of PRISMA made a difference in the quality of care delivered to one of his patients. Through PRISMA he was able to see that a specialist was able to identify a lung nodule on a shoulder MRI, but the report had not yet been sent over. That insight changed the patient’s care plan because the data from the specialist was easily accessible to him.\n\n“I didn’t get a note at all from the specialist, but it was viewable in notes that had come through [PRSIMA],” said Dr. Eaton. “Every day I’m able to see something through this interoperability platform that has a modest change in care for a patient.”\n\nFor MedPeds, PRISMA is making health data searchable and usable without creating new friction.\n\nTime to lean into AI Scribes and Practical Interoperability\n\nAmbient documentation and real interoperability aren’t theoretical anymore—they’re helping clinicians focus, improving care, and cutting out unnecessary duplication. The takeaway is clear: these tools work, but only when they’re designed to fit how clinicians already practice.\n\nIf your clinicians are still documenting after hours or struggling to access external records, it’s time to pilot a tool like Sunoh.ai or PRISMA and measure the difference.\n\nLearn more about MedPeds at https://www.medpeds.net/\n\nLearn more about Sunoh.ai at https://sunoh.ai/\n\nLearn more about PRISMA at https://plus.healow.com/clinical-insight/\n\nListen and subscribe to the Healthcare IT Today Interviews Podcast to hear all the latest insights from experts in healthcare IT.\n\nAnd for an exclusive look at our top stories, subscribe to our newsletter and YouTube.\n\nTell us what you think.

    "text": "The following is a guest article by Shane Cox, Director, Cyber Fusion Center at MorganFranklin Cyber\n\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping healthcare at an astonishing pace. From predictive diagnostics to robotic-assisted surgeries, AI’s potential to improve patient outcomes and streamline operations is undeniable. Yet, as hospitals, insurers, and providers embrace AI-driven automation, they also open the door to an entirely new wave of cyber risks. AI is no longer just an asset; it is also a liability if not properly secured.\n\nThe same advancements that allow AI to analyze vast amounts of medical data and detect diseases faster than any human doctor can also be manipulated to launch sophisticated cyberattacks. Threat actors are already using AI to craft highly convincing phishing campaigns, generate deepfake voices to trick hospital administrators into fraudulent payments, and automate denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can cripple critical healthcare systems. In an industry where downtime can be the difference between life and death, the stakes have never been higher.\n\nAI-Powered Threats Are Reshaping the Cybersecurity Landscape\n\nThe shift toward AI-driven cyberattacks is forcing healthcare security teams to play a game of cat and mouse at unprecedented speed. Traditional phishing scams were once easy to spot, riddled with typos and awkward phrasing. Now, AI can generate flawless, hyper-personalized phishing emails, mimicking the language, tone, and urgency of legitimate communications. Even security-aware employees struggle to tell the difference.\n\nDeepfake technology has added another layer of deception. Imagine a hospital finance director receiving a call that sounds exactly like the CFO, authorizing an urgent wire transfer for a medical supply purchase. The voice is eerily familiar, the details check out, and the pressure to act quickly is high. But it’s not the CFO. It’s an AI-generated deepfake, convincing enough to bypass even the most skeptical professionals. These scenarios are no longer hypothetical. They are happening now.\n\nAt the same time, attackers are also deploying AI-driven botnets to launch highly adaptive DDoS attacks. These campaigns flood hospital servers with traffic from distributed sources, overwhelming systems and rendering them unusable. Modern botnets can learn and shift tactics in real time, evading traditional defenses. Hospitals running outdated security systems are especially vulnerable to these disruptions, which can delay life-saving procedures and compromise patient care.\n\nThe Inherent Risks in AI Itself\n\nAI risks aren’t just limited to external attackers. When deployed hastily or without strong oversight, AI systems themselves can introduce new and overlooked vulnerabilities. Many healthcare organizations are embracing AI to enhance diagnostics, streamline workflows, and personalize treatment plans. But these models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. If a malicious actor gains access to the training dataset, they can manipulate outcomes through data poisoning, injecting corrupted or biased data that skews predictions and decision-making.\n\nThe consequences of such an attack can be severe. A tampered AI model might misdiagnose a patient, alter dosage recommendations, or prioritize treatments based on false variables. The potential for silent, systemic errors is a growing concern as AI becomes more deeply embedded in clinical decision-making.\n\nAI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants have also become commonplace for patient engagement, from scheduling appointments to offering symptom triage. These systems depend on APIs to communicate across platforms, and any misconfiguration can expose sensitive data. A single unsecured API can be an open door to attackers, compromising patient records, insurance information, and even clinical trial data.\n\nThe problem is compounded by the fact that many healthcare organizations lack visibility into the security posture of their AI vendors, and many providers integrate external AI tools without fully vetting their security protocols. This creates a fragmented and largely invisible ecosystem where AI applications operate beyond the reach of the hospital’s internal security team. When vendors lack strong security practices or when oversight is insufficient, this risk expands exponentially.\n\nA New Approach to AI Governance and Defense\n\nTo mitigate these risks, healthcare security leaders must implement stricter AI governance policies and enforce rigorous third-party risk assessments before integrating AI-powered tools into their environments. AI solutions should undergo regular security audits, penetration testing, and API monitoring to ensure vulnerabilities are identified and patched before they can be exploited. Additionally, adopting zero-trust architectures can help ensure that third-party tools only access what they absolutely need, minimizing potential exposure.\n\nFor healthcare organizations, conventional security strategies are no longer enough. Defending against AI-powered attacks requires more than just upgrading traditional security tools. The entire security strategy must evolve. Managed Detection and Response (MDR) systems need to incorporate AI-driven anomaly detection that can distinguish between normal hospital automation and malicious AI behavior. Security platforms should become predictive, not just reactive, analyzing patterns and dynamically adjusting defenses in real time.\n\nAt the same time, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) teams must rethink their investigative methods. The traditional approach of tracking digital footprints and identifying malware signatures is ineffective against self-learning, AI-generated threats. Security teams must develop advanced forensic capabilities to deconstruct AI-generated malware, trace deepfake fraud attempts, and counter AI-powered attack chains.\n\nPutting Security in Lockstep with Innovation\n\nAI security can no longer be an afterthought. It must be embedded into every phase of development and deployment, from initial design to daily operations. Security leaders and AI developers need to collaborate from the start, building systems with robust controls that prioritize patient safety and data integrity.\n\nThe future of healthcare depends on AI’s success, but its success depends on security. The industry must act now to build AI-powered defenses strong enough to withstand AI-powered attacks.\n\nAbout Shane Cox\n\nShane Cox is the Director of Cyber Fusion Center and Incident Response at MorganFranklin Cyber. With over 20 years of experience in cybersecurity operations, Shane specializes in building and optimizing security teams and programs for detection and response, security platform management, EDR/MDR, threat intelligence, automation, incident response, and vulnerability management.

    "text": "There is so much opportunity for innovation in healthcare right now, with so many advancements converging in one place AI has never been more powerful. Patients have never been more available through connected devices. Healthcare data is multiplying at an astounding rate. Combining all of these and more presents an incredible opportunity to truly impact the lives of patients.\n\nWhile we’re in what is probably the most exciting time for healthcare IT innovation and AI yet, there are still many challenges. One of those challenges is getting standardized access to the healthcare data, the kind needed for AI and other technology to make a difference. The good news is that with standards like FHIR maturing, this data is available for many healthcare innovators.\n\nIn many ways, this was the premise of the Predictive AI FHIR Integration Contest that was recently held by Darena Solutions. Many of the participants brought some great AI solutions to the table, but they needed access to the health data in EHR systems to really make their solution work. To participate in the contest, AI app makers had to leverage the MeldRx platform to integrate FHIR EHR data into their solution.\n\nThe contest had an incredible response from the developer community and had a wide range of AI and health IT solutions that were able to improve their solution by accessing EHR data through the MeldRx platform. After reviewing the contest entrants, the prestigious panel of judges selected MyHeartRisk as the grand prize winner.\n\nAs part of the winning prize package, Healthcare IT Today was happy to interview the contest winner to learn more about their solution. Lim Bing Feng and Calvin Koay, Co-Founders of MyHeartRisk, along with Pawan Jindal, Founder & CEO of Darena Solutions, recently joined me to discuss the contest, their innovative solution, and why MyHeartRisk stood out as the winner.\n\nIt was also fascinating to learn how Feng and Koay were able to come together to participate in the contest. One of them works in FinTech, but was excited to work on MyHeartRisk, which was based on the other’s healthcare informatics research work. Jindal noted that many of those who participated in the contest brought expertise from outside the healthcare industry.\n\nIt was great to hear how the contest was designed to solve one of the major problems that Feng and Koay faced with MyHeartRisk. They needed an easy way to integrate their AI solution with the EHR. That includes getting data from the EHR and integrating the results of their product back to the clinician in the EHR. They noted that many of the EHRs they were familiar with in their country didn’t have the FHIR APIs that are available in most US based EHR software.\n\nWhat I found even more interesting was Darena Solutions has big plans that go well beyond the contest.

    "text": "The following is a guest article by Brian Norris, Vice President & Managing Director of Strategic Consulting at MedeAnalytics\n\nWe’ve all heard the motivational proverb about the journey of one thousand miles beginning with a single step. The same goes for the first step in addressing a patient population’s social determinants of health (SDOH). Many factors comprise a patient’s SDOH profile, from transportation to air quality to the distance from their healthcare provider. The first step in the journey towards equalizing everyone’s SDOH can seem endless. There is no map, and forget about GPS. So which direction do you go? Which way do you turn for the best care? Does left or right make the most financial sense? Provider and payer organizations that embark on this journey will require assistance. Thankfully, with data, artificial intelligence, and the will to create a meaningful impact on people’s lives, the tools exist to guide these organizations towards the SDOH destination and create a roadmap for others to follow.\n\nKnowing where to make that first step is challenging because SDOH factors go beyond the four walls of a doctor’s office and beyond a health system’s typical realm of control. Yet we know various SDOH factors determine between 30% and 55% of a patient’s health outcomes, so understanding these non-medical contributors — the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age — can significantly influence their wellbeing. Before taking that first step, it’s only natural to ask the following questions:\n\nWhere can my healthcare organization impact our patient population with SDOH efforts?\n\nWhat aspect of SDOH makes the most financial sense to address first?\n\nWhat’s the return on investment?\n\nThe answers to these questions are becoming more attainable, thanks mainly to the massive amounts of data already available within the healthcare industry and advancements in artificial intelligence.\n\nData\n\nClaims data is one of the most useful datasets to assess the overall health of a patient population, and there’s a lot of it. Previous estimates suggest it’s somewhere in the petabytes. By combining claims trends with granular SDOH data and clinical insights, payers and providers can actuarially model and reveal the areas of most significant risk and the interventions with the greatest return on investment. Unfortunately, many healthcare organizations don’t know the value hidden within this data, especially when paired with predictive analytics and artificial intelligence. Taking this data and incorporating AI can help forecast real-world cost savings and better health outcomes.\n\nAI\n\nWith the right analytics and AI tools, organizations can move from simply acknowledging SDOH to predicting which social risk markers will most affect utilization, cost, and outcomes.\n\nFor example, if data shows that some patients frequently use the emergency room due to transportation challenges or lack of accessible follow-up care, targeted interventions like admission, discharge transfer alerts, and proactive care navigation can reduce these unnecessary admissions. When integrated at the point of care, this insight allows clinicians to make more informed decisions and organizations to streamline operations. It also enables care teams to follow up more effectively after emergency room visits. Pairing with AI, payers and providers can begin to predict which patients are more likely to fall through the cracks and offer suggestions for organizations to make impactful changes.\n\nThe Path Forward\n\nMore payers and providers are becoming legally obligated to address the SDOH of their members, especially among organizations embracing value-based care models. As more of these health systems, employers, Medicare Advantage plans, and self-insured groups continue to grow, so will the need for these organizations to focus on SDOH.\n\nThe SDOH journey is long. But the first step doesn’t have to be difficult. Like any long-distance traveler, you need a plan. And that’s true for healthcare organizations. While it may not be a typical map, data and AI can provide clear direction for the path ahead.\n\nAbout Brian Norris\n\nBrian Norris, MBA, RN, FHIMSS, has more than 25 years of experience in healthcare, 20 of those years as an RN and 15+ years in analytics, value-based care, and product development. As Vice President & Managing Director of Strategic Consulting, Brian leads the MedeAnalytics consulting practice focused on helping clients advance their value-based care strategies, deliver phenomenal outcomes to their populations, and assist organizations across the healthcare vertical with their most pressing clinical, operational, and outcomes challenges.\n\nMedeAnalytics recently partnered with Socially Determined and Mathematica to modernize the measurement, validation, and financial impact of SDOH interventions. By directly incorporating this information into an EHR, providers can make better SDOH-focused care decisions at the point of care.",

    "text": "The digitization of data, changes to how patient data is shared, and a wealth of real-world data (RWD) mean hospitals and drug developers can form richer insights on patient populations, improve clinical trial recruitment and develop more effective treatments for chronic conditions. But challenges to accessing and interpreting this data remain. These were some of the talking points of a webinar sponsored by PurpleLab, Eliminating Blind Spots in the Patient Journey.\n\nWebinar panelists included Steve Emrick, PurpleLab senior vice president of clinical informatics solutions and health nexus; Russ Cobb, PurpleLab chief marketing officer; and Dr. Ben Freiberg, Principal Informatics Systems Lead with Genentech’s gCS Computational Catalysts. Genentech is part of Roche.\n\nRWD can include data from an electronic medical record, medical claims data, data from disease registries or from connected devices.\n\n“When we look at large data sets, we need to think about what questions do we need the data to answer? If you’ve got clarity around that, then that can help filter out the noise,” Emrick said. “So with any patient journey, such as non-small cell lung cancer, when did the patient first start to have symptoms? What was the diagnosis? What type of medication did they get? Is it a targeted therapy versus a non-targeted therapy? Were there biomarker tests that were run? If not, why did they have access to that kind of treatment?”\n\nFreiberg observed that the more people can understand patient data beyond electronic medical records, the easier it will be to detect disease patterns and develop novel insights based on that information.\n\nThe webinar also highlighted:\n\nValue of getting more Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data\n\nThe influence of SDoH data in oncology\n\nPersonalized marketing to patients\n\nUsing RWD to transform clinical trial recruitment, clinical endpoints, and inform market access strategies\n\n\n\nTo access a recording of the webinar Eliminating Blind Spots in the Patient Journey, fill in the form below.\n\nPicture: yuoak, Getty Images",

    "text": "Consumerization of health has been a key part of the discussion when it comes to patients’ wishes. To hit the mark, patients expect convenience and better understanding of their overall health using digital solutions. With over one third of US adults using apps and wearables, using devices and apps to measure themselves, the connected patient can no longer be considered a niche or the future, it’s mainstream.\n\nA key moment that got us here was the summer of 2020, amid the Covid-19 shutdown, when the NBA tried to recoup part of its lost season by conducting its playoffs in a “bubble.” Practices and games were held in a controlled environment in Florida, the players had limited contact with anyone outside of their immediate teams, and regular testing was mandatory.\n\nKey to maintaining this bubble’s integrity: health monitoring devices that the players wore during this experience. These smart rings and trackers were often able to detect anomalies days before a positive Covid test, allowing doctors to isolate potentially sick players and lower the risk of viral spread.\n\nThe NBA bubble’s medtech experience was a promising example of a transformation that is now sweeping the healthcare establishment at large. Just as smartphones have put a world of information at consumers’ fingertips, a range of wearable devices and platforms has given patients timely access to their health readings, statistics, and more, whenever and wherever they choose.\n\nThese days, patients no longer want to rely upon only whatever snippets of information they get from their doctor at an annual or semiannual checkup. They’re looking for a fully connected patient experience. And healthcare organizations need to know what that looks like, how to build it, and how they fit into the full picture. Here are three tips that can help.\n\n1. Meet today’s patient expectations\n\nAlongside their physicians, patients have always been a part of their own care ecosystem. But the patient experience looks a bit different these days. More than just a bystander, today’s patients are often active participants in their care, and at all times – not just when they’re visiting or communicating with a healthcare professional. And technology is one of the main reasons. A few examples:\n\nSponsored Post The 6 Most Affordable Workflow Optimization Tools for Radiology Radiologists today face a surge in imaging volume and pressure to produce fast, accurate reports. Workflow optimization is about delivering the right results at the right time with less friction.\n\nWearables – such as Apple Watches, Oura rings, and FitBit trackers – allow users to continually track and monitor a wide array of health and fitness variables in real time.\n\n– such as Apple Watches, Oura rings, and FitBit trackers – allow users to continually track and monitor a wide array of health and fitness variables in real time. Digital health apps – including Noom, Strava, MyFitnessPal, and others – allow users to upload their data for tracking, insights, and advice.\n\n– including Noom, Strava, MyFitnessPal, and others – allow users to upload their data for tracking, insights, and advice. Gen AI offers yet another growing frontier in this space: 52 percent of Americans have asked tools like ChatGPT for a diagnosis based on their health info, and 53 percent would trust AI to develop a corresponding treatment plan.\n\nAll of these tools offer a lot more real-time data than patients have had access to in the past. And healthcare organizations need this data to flow back to them in order to provide the kind of effective personalization patients are looking for. Beyond the raw data, this effort requires powerful analytics tools that make it quick and easy to connect the dots and go from data to knowledge to action.\n\nSomething worth considering, though: patient expectations are going to be based on their digital experiences outside of the healthcare field. They’ve grown accustomed to highly connected experiences on platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Google, and they expect healthcare providers to meet a similar standard. This is why healthcare organizations need to raise the bar now to meet that heightened standard – or risk falling behind.\n\n2. Acknowledge the roadblocks – and address them\n\nThe road to a connected patient experience, however, is not necessarily a smooth one. And one of the main obstacles is a familiar one when it comes to technology. That is, while patients want to be more connected, they often still have trust issues.\n\nFor example, tech-savvy patients who do a lot of different things online may be concerned about data privacy and have questions about how exactly their data is going to be used. On the other side of the coin, meanwhile, less tech-focused patients are likely to need help just getting up to speed, especially if they’re unfamiliar with things like wearable devices and digital health apps.\n\nIn addition to addressing these disparate patient concerns, healthcare organizations also need to address their own data silos and fragmentation issues. Data unification and excellent governance practices are key to bringing patients’ health information together in a more convenient and digestible way.\n\n3. Build an experience rooted in access and trust\n\nHealthcare organizations looking to provide a successful connected patient experience should be focused on integration and app modernization to ensure their tech is:\n\nAccessible – Every step of the experience should be easy for patients at any level of technological sophistication to integrate into their lives, routines, and budgets.\n\n– Every step of the experience should be easy for patients at any level of technological sophistication to integrate into their lives, routines, and budgets. Open – Platforms and apps should allow multiple data sources to connect and work together.\n\nPlatforms and apps should allow multiple data sources to connect and work together. Secure – Even more than with their financial information, patients need to have the utmost confidence in the integrity and privacy of any system using their health data – and it’s up to the organizations providing those systems to earn that trust. Speak plain English; don’t hide behind jargon and lengthy legalese.\n\nBeyond present considerations, healthcare organizations should also be planning their connected patient experience with an eye toward the future. Again, Gen AI is likely the next big frontier in this journey.\n\nApart from enhancing patient interactions, Gen AI can also help physicians analyze disparate datasets, cross-reference with historical health data, identify trends or red flags, and suggest potential diagnoses or care plans. Find ways to explore these capabilities now, and you’ll avoid playing catch-up as the technology becomes ever more ubiquitous.\n\nA connected patient experience today will pay dividends down the road\n\nThe preferred point of care these days has moved from specific settings and times to anywhere and everywhere it’s convenient for the patient. For healthcare organizations, this should be a call to action. The apps and platforms they’re offering right now are not necessarily the ones patients will want or need going forward.\n\nThat’s why now is the time to focus on the connected patient experience. As technology and patient habits continue to evolve, the most competitive organizations will have systems that can change right along with those developments.\n\nPhoto: FG Trade, Getty Images\n\nLuiz Cieslak Luiz Cieslak is an SVP at CI&T a global digital specialist.

    "text": "The intersection of the pharmaceutical supply chain and national security has been front and center for years with on account of multiple events: such as the widespread shortages of IV fluids in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, made-in-China contrast media due to pandemic lockdowns, and generic oncology medications after a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection of an Indian manufacturer.\n\nMore recently, a Department of Commerce section 232 investigation, an Executive Order shoring up domestic manufacturing, and looming threats of tariffs have raised eyebrows regarding the strength of our nation’s pharmaceutical supply chain and whether it can truly weather preventable shocks.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nAmericans can forgo purchasing consumer goods or other items subject to tariffs for the period necessary for market forces to adjust and meet demand. In contrast, healthcare supplies have a direct correlation to the safety and national security of Americans as any disruption to availability jeopardizes the health of our nation. Americans cannot forego access to lifesaving medications.\n\nPharmaceuticals are not your average commodity, and it is important to note the following:\n\nAll medications are not created equal from a national security perspective. While medications provide a level of clinical benefit to patients, few are deemed essential by the FDA and Department of Defense (DOD) such that an inability to access such medications would result in catastrophic outcomes for Americans and threaten our national security.\n\nMost medications deemed essential by the FDA and DOD are generic medications that are often prone to drug shortages.\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturing is a highly regulated and complex process that takes significant financial investment and time. The repatriation of the pharmaceutical supply chain cannot occur overnight.\n\nThe availability of the medication delivery mechanism – such as needles, syringes, glass vials, rubber stoppers, IV fluid bags – can also impact the availability of medications.\n\nTo illustrate challenges with medications deemed critical for national security and their current manufacturing footprint, it is easy to highlight examples:\n\nSponsored Post The 6 Most Affordable Workflow Optimization Tools for Radiology Radiologists today face a surge in imaging volume and pressure to produce fast, accurate reports. Workflow optimization is about delivering the right results at the right time with less friction.\n\nSodium bicarbonate injection is used for urgent treatment of cardiac emergencies and has been prone to shortages since 2017. Since then, public and private investments have enabled domestic manufacturing of sodium bicarbonate to now account for over 97 percent of U.S. patient utilization. While predominantly manufactured in the U.S., the product remains at risk of shortage. This is a key example to demonstrate that domestic manufacturing alone does not equate to product availability and more investments are necessary to create resilient domestic production sources that can meet our nation’s needs.\n\nFentanyl citrate is an essential medication used for its analgesic and anesthetic properties that has been prone to shortage since 2012. While there are several domestic manufacturers of the finished dose and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), the key starting materials – poppy seeds – are primarily grown in Afghanistan and Australia which are then transported primarily to China for processing. This creates an upstream overreliance on, and production bottleneck by, foreign countries. Addressing the national security risk associated with fentanyl will require investments to move key starting material processing to the U.S. as well as agricultural investments to grow poppy seeds in the U.S.\n\nCephalosporin antibiotics refers to a class of medications that are used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections and have been prone to shortages since 2015. Cephalosporin antibiotics have no known domestic manufacturers of the finished dose and there are two predominant API manufacturers located in Italy and China. Although Italy is traditionally considered a U.S. ally, it imposed export embargoes on medical supplies during the pandemic. This demonstrates that overreliance on foreign countries for our essential medicines extends beyond China.\n\nWhile the thoughtful and targeted use of tariffs can boost supply chain resiliency in the long-term, material increases in tariffs on pharmaceuticals coupled with rapid implementation timelines can result in unintended consequences that increase costs and shortages in the short-term. Any unified trade policy on pharmaceuticals must ensure that overarching supply chain resiliency goals are met while minimizing the downstream impact to patient care. Therefore, the Administration must:\n\nDevelop a targeted approach to tariff implementation on pharmaceuticals that considers medications deemed essential by the FDA and DOD, separately from all other medications, due to their direct impact on national security;\n\nProvide a slow and steady glidepath approach to tariff implementation on pharmaceuticals to help ensure that both manufacturers and healthcare providers have sufficient time to respond and adapt to new tariffs while continuing to deliver essential healthcare services effectively;\n\nClarify the specific pharmaceutical categories that are or are not subject to tariffs, including clear definitions for the components of drugs subject to tariffs as well as the intersection of drugs and their associated delivery mechanisms;\n\nStudy the impacts of tariffs on the pharmaceutical supply chain to ensure that tariffs are meeting the end goal of spurring domestic ingenuity and identify any unintended consequences, such as increases in costs or shortages, necessitating swift remediation to prevent patient harm; and\n\nAugment supply chain resiliency efforts through additional mechanisms such as tax incentives supporting domestic manufacturing and the creation of trusted trade partnerships for near-shoring.\n\nTariffs on pharmaceuticals can provide an opportunity to reinforce the domestic supply chain, bolster product availability and protect patient care. But they cannot be implemented in a vacuum. Tariffs should be leveraged in a balanced approach with actionable outcomes directly correlated to measurable improvements in U.S. healthcare supply chain resiliency.\n\nPhoto: AlexLMX, Getty Images\n\nThis post appears through the MedCity Influencers program.

    "text": "Ganesh Padmanabhan, CEO and Co-founder, Autonomize AI\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is drowning in paperwork. McKinsey estimates spending on healthcare administration to be over $950 billion annually. More importantly, the time required for administration takes away from patient care, as the average physician spends 15.5 hours per week on administrative tasks. The complexity of healthcare administration is estimated to cost $68,000 per physician per year. While the United States continues to lead in medical advancements and leading-edge treatments, hospitals and care facilities are overwhelmed by inefficient workflows, manual processes, and an inability to access data.\n\nThe United States continues to lead in medical advancements and cutting-edge treatments, but hospitals and care facilities struggle with inefficient workflows, manual processes, and limited data accessibility. These challenges demand new thinking and technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), to cut through bureaucratic complexities and introduce efficiencies into healthcare workflows.\n\nThe consequences of excessive administrative overhead are far-reaching:\n\nCritical treatments delayed by prior authorization processes\n\nCase managers are forced to sift through fragmented data, leading to slower claims processing and higher error rates\n\nIncreased costs across the healthcare ecosystem\n\nAccelerated caregiver burnout\n\nGrowing patient frustration\n\nRather than making administrative tasks more efficient, the go-to response has been to cut costs by outsourcing and sending paperwork to lower-cost markets. Outsourcing is a stopgap, not a solution. Adopting AI to automate administrative processes and improve workflow efficiencies is a more sustainable approach.\n\nThe Bottleneck of Unstructured Data\n\nAccording to experts, the healthcare industry has accumulated approximately 2 zettabytes of data, representing about 30% of the world’s total data volume. To put it into perspective, that’s nearly 800 million gigabytes; and if each gigabyte were scaled down to the size of a marble, this length would stretch across the entire United States multiple times. This analogy helps underscore just how massive and complex the world of healthcare data truly is.\n\nWithin that volume, approximately eighty percent of healthcare data is unstructured, including medical records, patient-provider communications, imaging, lab reports, physician notes, patient monitor data, etc. Unstructured data is complex and difficult to organize in any useful fashion. It also becomes impossible to analyze at scale. A high-quality chest x-ray is 20 MB. A digital pathology file can require 50 MB to 6 GB of data storage. Now multiply this by thousands or millions of patients, and the challenge of storing and retrieving relevant clinical data becomes apparent.\n\nIt would be impossible to normalize and scale that data to make it accessible using conventional database technology. Technologists have been working to apply AI to the problem but are having difficulty overcoming the variations and nuances of clinical workflows. The solution is to break down workflows into administrative tasks that AI agents can make more efficient at lower costs.\n\nAI Agents: Contextual Intelligence for Healthcare\n\nFor AI to be effective in healthcare settings and workflows, it must be trained using domain-specific information. AI-powered processes must build upon pre-trained models and industry knowledge rooted in real-world clinical and administrative settings—essentially creating a healthcare-specific context for AI operations.\n\nWith proper training models and contextual understanding, AI-powered agentic workflows can extract meaning from unstructured data, converting free-text clinical narratives, handwritten notes, images, and unstructured data into actionable insights.\n\nAI agents can also integrate disparate data sources, creating unified, intelligent workflows by drawing from EMRs, imaging systems, and payer databases\n\nAdopting AI to power clinical workflows also ensures traceability and compliance. Workflow processes are explainable and auditable, which are critical for regulatory compliance.\n\nTransforming Healthcare Operations with AI Agents\n\nAI offers the ideal solution to tame complex clinical workflows and reduce administrative time and overhead. Rather than applying generic automation and adapting it to meet the unique requirements of healthcare, task-specific AI agents can be deployed to streamline administrative workflows.\n\nAI agents are task-specific software applications designed for healthcare. Each agent uses generative AI to digest and “understand” unstructured data and execute workflow-specific tasks. One of the benefits of using AI agents is that they can seamlessly integrate into both payer and provider operations. When properly applied, AI agents aren’t just software tools but function as force multipliers that make healthcare workers exponentially more productive and effective.\n\nAI agents can be used as building blocks to create customizable workflow engines. Each agent is optimized to handle a specific task. Here are just a few ways that AI agents can optimize healthcare workflows:\n\nStreamlining prior authorization – AI agents can quickly analyze patient records and match them to payer guidelines for preauthorization. Using AI is more efficient and accurate, cutting wait times from days to hours.\n\n– AI agents can quickly analyze patient records and match them to payer guidelines for preauthorization. Using AI is more efficient and accurate, cutting wait times from days to hours. Case management – AI is ideal for assimilating data from scattered sources and compiling case summaries. AI-powered analytics can give case managers a real-time portrait of a patient’s condition and treatment needs.\n\n– AI is ideal for assimilating data from scattered sources and compiling case summaries. AI-powered analytics can give case managers a real-time portrait of a patient’s condition and treatment needs. Closing care gaps – AI agents can scan unstructured patient records to identify missed treatments, tests, or other procedures, flagging care gaps so care teams can step in.\n\n– AI agents can scan unstructured patient records to identify missed treatments, tests, or other procedures, flagging care gaps so care teams can step in. Risk and quality assessments – AI-powered models can evaluate the quality of care and classify patient risks. Faster, more accurate care assessments drive proactive interventions for better patient outcomes.\n\nThe Human Impact of Administrative Efficiency\n\nWhen intelligently deployed, AI agents reduce administrative overhead in a way that improves the quality of care. Consider a 13-year-old suffering from debilitating migraines, forced to wait anxiously as vital medical care stalls due to paperwork shuffled between desks. Every day of delay means prolonged discomfort, missed school days, and mounting stress for both the patient and their family. These aren’t just inefficiencies—they’re unnecessary barriers standing between a child and timely treatment.\n\nAgentic AI workflows aren’t merely incremental improvements; they’re transformative shifts in healthcare operations. Imagine an intelligent AI agent automatically retrieving patient records, clinical notes, imaging results, and cross-referencing payer-specific guidelines instantly. In minutes—not weeks—a complete, compliant prior authorization package is ready, streamlining a process historically plagued by delays, rejections, and redundant manual reviews.\n\nThe result is more than just efficiency; it’s a fundamental reallocation of healthcare’s most precious resource—time. Clinicians are liberated from chasing paperwork, payers reduce costly administrative overhead, and patients receive swift, compassionate care. This is not a distant future scenario; it’s achievable today.\n\nHealthcare no longer has the luxury to outsource its administrative challenges or simply hire more staff to deal with more complexity. It needs smarter solutions. Agentic AI is that solution—providing a faster, scalable, and deeply human-centric alternative. Let AI handle the paperwork, so providers can return their attention to what matters most: delivering high-quality, timely care to patients who urgently need it.\n\nAbout Ganesh Padmanabhan\n\nGanesh Padmanabhan is CEO and Co-founder of Autonomize AI, specializing in harnessing artificial intelligence to improve knowledge workflows in healthcare.

    "text": "What You Should Know:\n\n– Today Amperos Health (Amperos) announces the launch of the world’s first multi-modal AI biller for healthcare providers, designed to combat denials and collect unpaid claims for revenue cycle management (RCM) teams.\n\n– With teams drowning in manual tasks to just gather the information needed to work denials, Amperos stands alone with its multi-modal platform, putting its AI coworker Amanda to work across both calling and insurance portals.\n\nAmperos Health: AI-Powered RCM Automation for a Broken Claims System\n\nAmperos Health is a New York-based healthtech company pioneering the first multi-modal AI biller purpose-built for revenue cycle management (RCM) teams. Designed to combat rising insurance denials and streamline claims processing, Amperos delivers a HIPAA-compliant, bank-grade secure platform that enables providers to resolve 2–5x more denials, recover significantly more revenue, and enhance RCM team productivity. Since its founding in 2023, Amperos has automated over 75,000 calls—equivalent to the workload of 60 full-time billers—and helped clients recover $120 million in annual revenue.\n\nAt the core of Amperos’s offering is “Amanda,” an AI coworker trained by experienced healthcare billers to manage high-volume, low-value claims interactions. Amanda combines voice and browser-based automation to handle two essential tasks:\n\n· She autonomously conducts follow-up calls with insurance companies regarding outstanding or denied claims, saving billers hundreds of hours daily.\n\n· She natively navigates payer portals to retrieve claim statuses and pull key denial or payment information.\n\nAmanda’s multi-modal intelligence enables her to act across systems—cross-referencing data from web portals with real-time phone conversations to adjudicate claims more effectively. She then consolidates this information into the Amperos platform, enabling human billers to focus their expertise on complex, high-impact cases. Unlike many healthcare AI solutions that require extensive scripting and onboarding, Amanda is fully functional out of the box—no custom configuration or lengthy implementation process required.\n\nAddressing the RCM Crisis in U.S. Healthcare\n\nAmperos emerges at a time of growing instability in the healthcare revenue cycle. Several interlinked challenges underline the urgency of intelligent automation:\n\n· Insurance denial rates are increasing 10% annually, with 15% of claims initially rejected.\n\n· These denials represent over $200 billion in lost revenue each year, even as $26 billion is spent on adjudication and collections—despite 70% of denied claims ultimately being overturned.\n\n· Staffing shortages remain a major obstacle, with 63% of RCM teams reporting understaffing and turnover rates ranging from 11–40% annually.\n\n· Flat reimbursement rates coupled with rising operational costs are pushing clinics—especially small and rural providers—to reduce services or shut down entirely.\n\n· Existing RCM infrastructure is outdated and vulnerable. The Change Healthcare cyberattack that paralyzed claim processing for months forced providers to take on debt just to stay operational.\n\nLeadership & Funding\n\nThe Amperos team brings cross-sector expertise in AI, healthcare, and enterprise systems:\n\n· CEO Michal Miernowski offers a decade of investment and advisory experience in healthcare and financial services.\n\n· CPO Alvin Wu previously led product and engineering teams at companies including Samsara, Fitbit, and Backbone.\n\n· CTO Wilson Wang, an early innovator in LLM and voice agent development, formerly worked at Amazon.\n\nThe company recently closed a $4.2 million seed round led by Uncork Capital, Neo, and Nebular, with participation from strategic angels from OpenAI, Twilio, and Stripe—bringing total funding to $5 million.\n\nAmperos Health aims to make reimbursement an invisible part of healthcare delivery—so providers can focus on growth and patient care, not administrative survival.",

The SONU Band system is designed to be easy, convenient, and pleasant for patients to use. It employs SoundHealth’s proprietary AI technology through the SONU app. The app uses a smartphone to scan the patient’s face, creating a digital map of their sinuses and calculating their optimal resonant frequencies. Following this one-time scan, the patient places the SONU Band around their head; when activated, the band delivers these precisely tailored frequencies.\n\nThe underlying science involves acoustic vibrational energy. The band produces resonant sound waves that gently vibrate the nasal cavity. These micro-vibrations are designed to help reduce swelling, open nasal passages, and promote the drainage of healthy mucus. Research has shown that acoustic vibration, similar to humming, can decrease symptoms of nasal congestion, potentially by modulating autonomic inputs to the nasal mucosa or through nitric oxide activity, which may exert a decongestant and anti-inflammatory effect.\n\nClinically Proven Efficacy and Rapid Relief\n\nClinical evidence has shown the SONU Band to be fast-acting and effective, with over 80 percent of patients reporting an improvement in their nasal symptoms. SoundHealth states that SONU is the only FDA-approved device demonstrated to be equivalent to or better than the leading nasal steroid spray in calming symptoms of allergies, inflammation, and congestion.\n\n“Nasal congestion and allergies don’t have to be life-altering,” said Dr. Paramesh Gopi, founder and CEO of SoundHealth, who started the company partly due to his personal journey with lifelong allergies. “Our team of scientists, engineers and medical professionals has truly revolutionized respiratory health with AI-powered sound therapy. We are thrilled to now be able to offer relief from congestion to children and will continue to work toward helping people breathe better”. Dr. Gopi developed the SONU Band in collaboration with Stanford Physicians Peter Hwang and Bryant Lin.",

    "text": "Morley: ‘We need greater regulation of ambient voice technologies’\n\nDr Jessica Morley (Image provided by Morley)\n\nSelf-confessed “100% health nerd” Dr Jessica Morley is a leading voice on ethics in digital healthcare and one of the most exciting speakers on the health tech conference circuit.\n\nBased in the US, where she is a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University Digital Ethics Center, Morley combines ardent enthusiasm for digital with a blunt rejection of hype.\n\nAhead of speaking at Digital Health Summer Schools, the former tech advisor to the UK government told Digital Health News why she objects to the “hyper-personalisation” of AI in the NHS and how the danger from uncontrolled use of ambient voice technologies is greater than it seems.\n\nYou have suggested the NHS is too focused on individual health and has “missed the opportunity to leverage AI for the population”. What needs to change?\n\nThis is basically the continuation of a long running trend to make health less about the system and the state’s responsibility and more about the individual’s responsibility. And that’s couched in terms of ‘empowering’ the person, but there are all these systemic things that impact people’s ability to change their health status.\n\nIf you don’t also change the surroundings and make it easier for people to act on information you are essentially just victim blaming.\n\nDoing things that tackle the social determinants of health is very complicated: what are the factors, how are they interacting, and how do we intervene in the system? AI has a phenomenal ability to unpick and help us understand those things.\n\nIdeally, I would like the 10 year health plan, or the things that follow on from it, to not just be about this hyper-personalisation.\n\nA lot of NHS data strategy has been about building vertical data sets, but what we want is more horizontal data sets with the capability to look at things like environmental data.\n\nThere are growing numbers of people in the foothills who recognise that [hyper-personalisation] is a problem. But until someone makes a compelling economic argument that focusing only on using AI for individual care is not going to deliver the efficiency gains the government wants, I think we’ll struggle to make the change.\n\nThe UK government has published guidance to encourage the use of ambient voice technologies (AVT). Is the focus on AVT necessary?\n\nThe guidance is a response to reality. If you don’t use these things in a controlled way, they’re very dangerous.\n\nI think the level of risk posed by these technologies is underestimated. People think that all they’re doing is listening, but they’re not – they’re interpreting and inferring, and we all know that there are problems with hallucinations and accuracy.\n\nMost of them should fall within the specification of software as a medical device and they are not currently recognised as that.\n\nThere should be far greater regulation of these tools. There are cases where these things are inventing that someone had a test they are supposed to have – and then it never happens. You start having knock-on effects such as misdiagnosis or late diagnosis.\n\nI don’t think we can blame the market, because the market is responding to what it thinks the system wants.\n\nHow do you rate the UK’s chances of becoming, in the prime minister’s words, “an AI superpower”?\n\nIt is just political speak – but the UK is by no means alone. That’s what the US and the EU is saying. It’s what China is saying.\n\nIn terms of how realistic it is, there are trade-offs between the different big players in this space. There is significantly more money in the US and a big move to deregulate that’s coming from the current administration.\n\nWe need to import more people to become a genuine global superpower in AI\n\nWe have fantastic universities in the UK, amazing research, and potentially excellent health data. But we don’t have people power in the UK. We need to import more people to become a genuine global superpower in AI, but you can’t do that if you’re also restricting people who are coming in with skilled visa entries.\n\nSometimes the complexity of what it really takes to become an AI superpower is misunderstood. Lots of complexities were, I think, missed in the AI opportunities plan.\n\nYou have people on the ground who are struggling to keep their head above water. And instead of listening to those problems and saying “what do we need to do to fix this?” the government says “AI is the solution – you should just adopt more AI’”.\n\nThe reality is there are hospitals that don’t have an electronic health record and places that have one computer between three different wards. Those things need fixing first.\n\nCan we use health data ethically without slowing the rate of progress?\n\nYes – it is entirely possible to leverage data ethically, acceptably, and not slow the pace of innovation. The idea that either you have the public good or patient privacy is a complete myth.\n\nIt is a technical issue that we have largely solved. [The problem is] people are lazy and don’t want to work in more complicated ways. Instead of dealing with the risk technically what they have done is put in place an awful lot of forms. You can reduce the number of forms by building the technical infrastructure – and a better technical infrastructure would be ethical.\n\nYou can protect patient privacy, make it far more transparent and accountable, by making sure there are restrictions on who is accessing it, who can see it, and tracking what it is going on.\n\nCan you give us a sense of what you will be speaking about at Summer Schools?\n\nAI and the NHS – in a nutshell.\n\nJessica Morley will be speaking at Digital Health’s Summer Schools 2025, 17-18 July at the University of Warwick. The event is supported by Networks sponsors Alcidion, AWS, Altera, Bridgehead, CereCore, Dell Technologies + AMD, Imprivata, Intersystems, Microsoft and Salesforce.",

That must change.\n\n“This three-year grant will help researchers push the boundaries of AI-driven technology for cancer detection and diagnosis.\n\n“This AI-powered service represents the cutting edge of cancer research, and it is going to transform treatment, better support NHS staff and ultimately change patients’ lives.\n\n“It is another great example of how NIHR-funded and supported research will ensure the best care is there when patients need it.”\n\nMeanwhile, in March 2025, The Royal Marsden rolled out an advanced radiotherapy planning system to enhance personalised treatment for patients.",
